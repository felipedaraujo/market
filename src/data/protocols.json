Circadian clocks contain transcriptional feedback loops that are thought to generate circadian timing. There is considerable similarity in the genes that comprise the transcriptional and translational feedback loops of the circadian clock in the plant Kingdom. Functional characterisation of circadian clock genes has been restricted to a few model species. Here we provide a functional characterisation of the Hordeum vulgare (barley) circadian clock genes Hv CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (HvCCA1) and Hv PHOTOPERIODH1, which are respectively most similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (AtCCA1) and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (AtPRR7). This provides insight into the circadian regulation of one of the major crop species of Northern Europe. Through a combination of physiological assays of circadian rhythms in barley and heterologous expression in wild type and mutant strains of A. thaliana we demonstrate that HvCCA1 has a conserved function to AtCCA1. We find that Hv PHOTOPERIOD H1 has AtPRR7-like functionality in A. thaliana and that the effects of the Hv photoperiod h1 mutation on photoperiodism and circadian rhythms are genetically separable.\n"],"title":"Barley Hv CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 and Hv PHOTOPERIOD H1 Are Circadian Regulators That Can Affect Circadian Rhythms in Arabidopsis","materials_and_methods":["\nCloning of HvCCA1 into Arabidopsis\nThe entire HvCCA1 transcript was amplified using KOD TAQ polymerase (Novagen). HvCCA1 was cloned into GATEWAY pCR8/GW/TOPO entry vector using pCR8/GW/TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. HvCCA1 was then subcloned into the binary plazmid PMDC32 using the Gateway LR recombination reaction (Invitrogen). The binary plasmid PMDC32 confers hygromycin resistance in plants and contains a double 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter for constitutive expression of the inserted gene [16]. The CaMV35S:HvCCA1 was introduced into GV3101 Agrobacterium tumefaciens and subsequently into Arabidopsis thaliana Ws-2 via the floral dip method [17]. Out of 21 primary transformants, nine were identified as homozygous lines carrying an insert at a single locus. HvCCA1 overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR (S1 Fig). Homozygous lines were used for all experiments.\n\nRNA extraction and transcript analysis\nFor circadian experiments seedlings were grown at 22°C in 12 h:12 h L:D for 7 days before being transferred to continuous light for 54 h. Samples were taken every 6 h until 72 h. Plant tissue was disrupted in the TissueLyser (QIAGEN) and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesised from 0.5 μg of template RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). For quantitative PCR, transcript abundance was measured using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Transcript abundance of AtCCA1, AtLHY and AtTOC1 was normalised to UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ). The primers for q-PCR reactions are presented in S1 Table. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Normalization and transcript abundance calculations were automated and performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System software.\n\nNon-homologous Complementation of Arabidopsis PRR Mutants\nArabidopsis PRR7 T-DNA insertion mutant (prr7-11) was complemented with HvPpd-H1 and Hvppd-H1 to test for similarity of function between AtPRR7 and HvPpd-H1. pENTRPpdH1 (Igri) cDNA and of pENTRppdH1 (Triumph) were generated, each containing a fragment comprising the coding region of the HvPpdH1 or HvppdH1 cDNA from Cultivar “Igri” or “Triumph” respectively, cloned directionally into a pENTR-D plasmid (Invitrogen, UK). The genomic AtPRR7 (AT5G02810) promoter (p) sequence was used to drive the HvPpd-H1 cDNA sequences extending from -871 to +1 bases where the first nucleotide of the inferred ATG initiation codon. The promoter was amplified (S1 Table) from pAtPRR7:LUC, a luciferase binary vector supplied by C. Robertson McClung, originally derived from pZPomegaLUCplus [18] by replacement of the gentamicin resistance cassette with the BASTA resistance gene from p35SBarn [19]. The resulting vector, pZPBAR, was then made Gateway compatible (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by inserting the PCR-amplified attR-flanked destination cassette from pK7WG2D [20] at the BamHI and HindIII sites upstream of LUC to create pZPBAR-DONR. The AtPRR7 promoter was inserted into pZPBAR-DONR. The binary vector used was pBGW, supplied by the Functional Genomics unit of the Department of Plant Systems Biology (VIB-Ghent University). The 894 bp pAtPRR7 product and pENTR-D Topo Ppd-H1 and pENTR-D Topo ppd-H1 recipient plasmids were digested with SacII restriction enzyme. The digested pENTR-D Topo PpdH1 and pENTR-D Topo ppdH1 samples were dephosphorylated by adding Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) buffer (Fermentas, UK),. The pAtPRR7 insert DNA and pENTR-D Topo PpdH1 / ppdH1 vector backbones were mixed in a ratio of 3:1 (insert:backbone) with ligase (New England BioLabs, UK) and incubated at 4°C overnight. pENTR-D Topo PpdH1 or pENTR-D Topo ppdH1 with the AtPRR7 promoter were introduced into chemically competent DH5α E. coli cells (Invitrogen, UK). Colony PCR was used to identify bacteria carrying the pENTR-D Topo PpdH1 or pENTR-D Topo ppdH1 with the AtPRR7 promoter in the correct orientation. Plasmid DNA was isolated using Promega miniprep Wizard kits (Promega, UK). The insertion and orientation of AtPRR7 into the pENTR-D Topo backbones was verified again by restriction digestion alongside the parent plasmids using SacI and SacII. Plasmids carrying the AtPRR7 promoter in the correct insertion were fully sequenced through the AtPRR7 promoter and the Igri or Triumph coding regions. A. tumefasciens strain GV3101 was transformed with pBGW-PRR7:PpdH1 or pBGW-PRR7:ppdH1 and then used to transform Arabidopsis by floral dip [17]. Positive transformants were selected by spray with Finale glufosinate ammonium (0.31% v/v; Bayer, Germany). For physiological assays the F2 transgenic plants were used.\nTo ensure functionality of the promoter construct tissue was collected from 12-day-old seedlings grown in 12 h light–12 h dark cycles (100 μmol m−2 s−1) six h after dawn. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue of three biological replicates of at least five pooled plants each, using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and RNase-Free DNase on-column treatment (QIAGEN). cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng RNA with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) using oligo(dT) primers. The gene-specific products were amplified using the Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Kit on a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time PCR machine (QIAGEN). The primer sequences were: PP2a-F, 5′-TAACGTGGCCAAAATGATGC-3′; PP2a-R, 5′-GTTCTCCACAACCGCTTGGT-3′ and Hvppd-H1-F, 5′-GATGGATTCAAAGGCAAGGA-3′; Hvppd-H1-R, 5′-GAACAATTGGCTCCTCCAAA-3′ [12]. Relative transcript levels were determined by incorporating PCR efficiencies [21].\n\nCircadian rhythms of leaf movement, delayed fluorescence and analysis of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time in Arabidopsis\nFor leaf movement, delayed fluorescence and hypocotyl elongation experiments Arabidopsis seed was surface-sterilized in 70% ethanol for 1 min, followed by 50% (w/v) bleach for 10 min and 3 rinses with distilled water. Seeds were resuspended in 0.15% (w/v) agar and stratified at 4°C for 3 days prior to sowing on Murashige and Skoog medium 1.5% (w/v) agar plates. For leaf movement, ten day old seedlings entrained to 12h light 12 h dark cycles were moved to Sanyo MLR350 plant growth chambers and imaged under constant light at 22°C [22].\nDelayed chlorophyll fluorescence was imaged in a Sanyo MIR-553 cooled incubator (Sanyo Gallenkamp, UK) using an ORCA-II-BT 1024 16-bit camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) cooled to -80°C [20]. Images from leaf movement and delayed fluorescence were processed using Metamorph 6.0 image-analysis software (Molecular Devices, UK). Period estimates and relative amplitude errors (RAE) were calculated in BRASS (available from http://www.amillar.org/downloads.html) by running fast Fourier transformed non-linear least-square analysis [23]. RAE is a measure of rhythm robustness that ranges from 0 (a perfect fit to the wave) to 1 (no fit).\nHypocotyl length was measured in ten day old seedlings grown at 22°C in 12h light 12 h dark of 100 μmol m-2 s-1. Seedlings were harvested and laid flat on agar plates for imaging. Images of Arabidopsis seedlings were analysed in Metamorph 6.0. Student’s t-test was used to determine statistical significance between the controls and mutants.\nFlowering time assays were performed on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in a controlled environment under 16h light 8 h dark at 22°C. The flowering time was expressed as a number of days and rosette leaves when a bolt of 0.5 cm long was observed.\n\nInfra-Red Gas Exchange Analyser (IRGA) Assay of Circadian Rhythms in Arabidopsis and barley\nCircadian rhythms of gas exchange in Arabidopsis plants was measured as described in [24]. For measurement of circadian gas exchange in individual barley plants an IRGA system based on the portable LI-COR LI-6400XT (LI-COR, USA) was developed. Humid CO2 free air was obtained by pumping atmospheric air through two 4.5 cm x 30 cm cylinders in series filled with soda lime (Fisher Scientific, UK) and a flask of water. Relative humidity was limited to a maximum of 85% through the control of the IRGA. CO2 (BOC, UK) was provided at between 180 and 220 PSIG and a flow of 500 μmol s-1. The [CO2] in the chamber was controlled at 380 PPM. A 6 cm2 area of mature barley (4–8 weeks old) leaf was clamped in the cuvette with a clear glass screen and therefore received illumination from the cabinet equivalent to that of the rest of the plant. Gaseous exchange was recorded every 10 min.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910/conclusions","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nWe use the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), formulated as a comparative spectral decomposition, to model patient-matched grades III and II, i.e., lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain tumor and normal DNA copy-number profiles. A genome-wide tumor-exclusive pattern of DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) is revealed, encompassed in that previously uncovered in glioblastoma (GBM), i.e., grade IV astrocytoma, where GBM-specific CNAs encode for enhanced opportunities for transformation and proliferation via growth and developmental signaling pathways in GBM relative to LGA. The GSVD separates the LGA pattern from other sources of biological and experimental variation, common to both, or exclusive to one of the tumor and normal datasets. We find, first, and computationally validate, that the LGA pattern is correlated with a patient’s survival and response to treatment. Second, the GBM pattern identifies among the LGA patients a subtype, statistically indistinguishable from that among the GBM patients, where the CNA genotype is correlated with an approximately one-year survival phenotype. Third, cross-platform classification of the Affymetrix-measured LGA and GBM profiles by using the Agilent-derived GBM pattern shows that the GBM pattern is a platform-independent predictor of astrocytoma outcome. Statistically, the pattern is a better predictor (corresponding to greater median survival time difference, proportional hazard ratio, and concordance index) than the patient’s age and the tumor’s grade, which are the best indicators of astrocytoma currently in clinical use, and laboratory tests. The pattern is also statistically independent of these indicators, and, combined with either one, is an even better predictor of astrocytoma outcome. Recurring DNA CNAs have been observed in astrocytoma tumors’ genomes for decades, however, copy-number subtypes that are predictive of patients’ outcomes were not identified before. This is despite the growing number of datasets recording different aspects of the disease, and due to an existing fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can simultaneously find similarities and dissimilarities across the datasets. This illustrates the ability of comparative spectral decompositions to find what other methods miss.\n"],"title":"Platform-Independent Genome-Wide Pattern of DNA Copy-Number Alterations Predicting Astrocytoma Survival and Response to Treatment Revealed by the GSVD Formulated as a Comparative Spectral Decomposition","materials_and_methods":["LGA Discovery Datasets Construction. We selected an LGA discovery set of 59 TCGA patients of consistent survival annotations. The 59 patients were diagnosed with World Health Organization (WHO) grades III or II astrocytoma. The patient-matched primary LGA tumor and normal tissue samples were obtained from US tissue source sites. Each tumor or normal profile lists median-centered log2 TCGA raw level 2 of the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0-measured DNA copy numbers. The profiles are organized in one tumor and one normal dataset, of M1, M2 = 933,827 autosomal and X chromosome nonpolymorphic copy-number probes, with valid data in all N = 59 patient-matched pairs of tumor and normal profiles, respectively.CNAs in the LGA Pattern. To compare the Affymetrix-derived LGA pattern to the Agilent-derived GBM pattern, we mapped the 933,827 Affymetrix probes that constitute the LGA pattern onto the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human genome sequence build 36 at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) human genome browser [58]. Previously, we also mapped the 212,696 probes of the Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A microarray platform that constitute the GBM pattern onto the same sequence. We then assigned to the LGA pattern CNAs in the chromosomes and chromosome arms, as well as the 111 of the 130 genomic segments that were previously identified in the GBM pattern by using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) [59], which are of ≥5 Agilent probes in length.The LGA pattern was assigned a gain or a loss in a chromosome or a chromosome arm if the deviation of the mean copy number of the chromosome or the arm from the genomic mean is greater than twice the genomic standard deviation. The genomic mean and standard deviation are calculated for the autosomal genome, excluding the outlying chromosomes 7 and 10, and chromosome arm 9p [8]. A gain or a loss in a segment were assigned if the deviation of the segment mean copy number from the genomic mean is greater than twice the genomic standard deviation, or if the deviation from the chromosomal mean is greater than the chromosomal standard deviation, when this deviation is consistent with the deviation from the genomic mean.Cross-Platform Probe Matching. We matched pairs of one Agilent and one Affymetrix probe that overlap by at least one nucleotide. When multiple Affymetrix or Agilent probes overlapped a single Agilent or Affymetrix probe, the Affymetrix or Agilent probe closest to the genomic end or start coordinate of the Agilent or Affymetrix probe was selected, respectively, to maintain a one-to-one matching between the platforms. This identified 8,102 pairs of one-to-one overlapping Affymetrix and Agilent probes.To identify the 4,697 pairs of one-to-one overlapping probes that are consistently aberrated in the LGA and GBM patterns, we assigned to the patterns CNAs in the 8,102 Affymetrix and Agilent probes, respectively. A gain or a loss in a probe were assigned if the deviation of the probe copy number from the genomic mean is greater than twice the genomic standard deviation, or if the deviation from the chromosomal mean is greater than the chromosomal standard deviation, when this deviation is consistent with the deviation from the genomic mean.Arraylet Visualization. To visualize the first tumor arraylet and 53rd normal and tumor arraylets, we segmented each arraylet by using the CBS [59].Probelet Interpretation. To biologically or experimentally interpret the first and 53rd probelets, which are the most significant probelets in the tumor and normal datasets, respectively, we assessed the subsets of patients that are of high or low relative copy numbers in each probelet for enrichment in any one of the multiple TCGA annotations that describe the patients (e.g., gender), and the corresponding tumor and normal tissue samples (e.g., the hybridization plate of the tumor vs. the normal samples). The P-value of each enrichment was calculated assuming a hypergeometric probability distribution of the K annotations among the N patients of the discovery set, and of the subset of k ⊆ K observed annotations among the subset of n patients that are of high or low copy numbers in each probelet [60], P(k;n,N,K)=(Nn)−1∑i=kn(Ki)(N−Kn−i).In each probelet, we also assessed the distribution of the copy numbers among the different groups of each TCGA annotation by using boxplots, and calculating the corresponding Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon P-values.LGA Validation Dataset Construction. We selected an LGA validation set of 74 TCGA patients, which is mutually exclusive of the discovery set. Missing data among the 933,827 Affymetrix probes of the LGA pattern in any of the corresponding tumor profiles were not estimated. The corresponding probes were excluded from the calculations of this profile’s median copy number as well as the profile’s Pearson correlations with the LGA and GBM patterns.GBM Dataset Construction. We selected a GBM set of 364 patients from the previous GBM discovery and validation sets [8]. For patients with more than one primary tumor profile, medians of the profiles were taken. Missing data among the 933,827 Affymetrix probes of the LGA pattern in any of the corresponding tumor profiles were not estimated. The corresponding probes were excluded from the calculations of this profile’s median copy number as well as the profile’s correlations with the GBM pattern.MGMT Promoter Methylation and IDH1 Mutation Annotations. To estimate the MGMT promoter methylation status of a tumor, we used the TCGA raw level 1 of the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 27 or 450 BeadChip-measured DNA methylation levels [64].The IDH1 mutation status of the LGA and GBM tumors is from TCGA [38, 68]."]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164546/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["Background: The spread of multi-resistant infections represents a continuously growing problem in cirrhosis, particularly in patients in contact with the healthcare environment. Aim: Our prospective study aimed to analyze epidemiology, prevalence and risk factors of multi-resistant infections, as well as the rate of failure of empirical antibiotic therapy in cirrhotic patients. Methods: All consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized between 2008 and 2013 with a microbiologically-documented infection (MDI) were enrolled. Infections were classified as Community-Acquired (CA), Hospital-Acquired (HA) and Healthcare-Associated (HCA). Bacteria were classified as Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) if resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, Extensively-Drug-Resistant (XDR) if only sensitive to one/two classes and Pandrug-Resistant (PDR) if resistant to all classes. Results: One-hundred-twenty-four infections (15% CA, 52% HA, 33% HCA) were observed in 111 patients. Urinary tract infections, pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were the more frequent. Forty-seven percent of infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Fifty-one percent of the isolates were multi-resistant to antibiotic therapy (76% MDR, 21% XDR, 3% PDR): the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR = 8.4; 95%CI = 1.03-76; P = 0,05) and current/recent contact with the healthcare-system (OR = 3.7; 95%CI = 1.05-13; P = 0.04) were selected as independent predictors. The failure of the empirical antibiotic therapy was progressively more frequent according to the degree of resistance. The therapy was inappropriate in the majority of HA and HCA infections. Conclusions: Multi-resistant infections are increasing in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. A better knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics is important to improve the efficacy of empirical antibiotic therapy. The use of preventive measures aimed at reducing the spread of multi-resistant bacteria is also essential.

All of these parameters use a single time threshold to judge the maximum tolerable peak enhancement delay that is supposed to reliably differentiate sufficient from critical perfusion. As the validity of this single threshold approach still remains unclear, in this study, (1) the definition of a threshold on an individual patient-basis, nevertheless (2) preserving the comparability of the data, was investigated. Methods: The histogram of time-to-peak (TTP) values derived from DSC-MRI, the so-called TTP-distribution curve (TDC), was modeled using a double-Gaussian model in 61 patients without severe cerebrovascular disease. Particular model-based zf-scores were used to describe the arterial, parenchymal and venous bolus-transit phase as time intervals Ia,p,v. Their durations (delta Ia,p,v), were then considered as maximum TTP-delays of each phase. Results: Mean-R2 for the model-fit was 0.967. Based on the generic zf-scores the proposed bolus transit phases could be differentiated. The Ip-interval reliably depicted the parenchymal bolus-transit phase with durations of 3.4 s–10.1 s (median = 4.3s), where an increase with age was noted (∼30 ms/year). Conclusion: Individual threshold-adjustment seems rational since regular bolus-transit durations in brain parenchyma obtained from the TDC overlap considerably with recommended critical TTP-thresholds of 4 s–8 s. The parenchymal transit time derived from the proposed model may be utilized to individually correct TTP-thresholds, thereby potentially improving the detection of critical perfusion. "],"title":"Improved Quantification of Cerebral Hemodynamics Using Individualized Time Thresholds for Assessment of Peak Enhancement Parameters Derived from Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging","materials_and_methods":["\nPatients\nPatients who received DSC-MRI examinations at our institution were selected from our database (n =  app. 5881) using randomly generated study dates (http://www.random.org). Inclusion criteria were: (1.) sufficient image quality of DSC-MRI to calculate perfusion maps, (2.) no sign of focal diffusion restriction in diffusion weighted MRI at a b-value of 1000 s/mm2, (3.) no tumor or other defects (e.g., due to infarct or bleeding) with a size >5 mm, (4.) no sign of any other focal disturbance of the blood-brain-barrier or of a vascular malformation, (5.) no cerebrovascular stenotic or occlusive process detectable on MR-angiography (range: aortic arch to the circle of Willis), and (6.) no severe, presumably microangiopathic alterations ( =  grades 2 and 3 according to the Fazekas 4-grades scoring system [15]). Approval of the study, registered under: GS4-EK-4/220-2013, was obtained from the Lower Austrian Ethics Commission. Informed consent of retrospectively acquired data from the database was not required since all data were analyzed anonymously. Prospectively included patients (stroke examples) gave written informed consent prior to participation in this study and were also processed anonymously in the further work up.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nAll examinations were performed on a clinical 1.5T MR-scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems-Erlangen, Germany). The standard perfusion protocol (54 patients) included DSC-MRI, diffusion weighted MRI (dual-b SE-EPI: b1 = 0 s/mm2; b2 = 1000 s/mm2), MR-angiography and conventional MRI including enhanced PD/T2w-IR-imaging [16]. DSC-MRI was performed using a short-TR dynamic contrast enhanced T2*-weighted single shot GRE-EPI-sequence (TR = 689 ms/TE = 17 ms/FOV = 240 mm/slice thickness: 6 mm/image matrix: 164×208 voxels) that allowed acquisition of 81 image-stacks, with 20 slices each, at a scan time of approx. 60 seconds. Additionally, 2 patients (female, 81 a; male, 44a) suffering from acute stroke, who were examined with the standard perfusion protocol, could be assessed with the proposed method in order to gain some preliminary data about potential limitations of individual threshold adaptions. Corresponding diffusion weighted imaging from follow-up examinations >48 h after stroke were compared to the initial infarct prediction of zf-score maps obtained in the acute phase. Alternatively to the standard perfusion protocol, a comparable GRE-EPI-sequence (7 patients) with: TR = 1030 ms/TE = 16 ms/FOV = 240 mm/slice thickness: 6 mm/image matrix: 204×204 voxels was employed for DSC-MRI, which enabled acquisition of 50 image-stacks, with 20 slices each, within approx. 52 seconds. The corresponding sampling rates for the global brain bolus passage were 1.45 Hz (TR = 689 ms) and 0.97 Hz (TR = 1030 ms), respectively, for an expected regular minimal arterio-venous bolus-transit time of about 3.5 s [17], [18].\n\nModeling of the Global TTP-Distribution\nAnonymized DSC-MRI examinations were transferred to a PC-work station and stdTTP-maps were computed using in-house developed software (jPerfusionModule; v 2.0.0; available from the corresponding author). Hypoperfusion was ruled out in all cases by stdTTP, which is described in detail elsewhere [6], [12]. The computing kernel of stdTTP provides also a global TTP-distribution curve (TDC) and the correlated mean signal curve (MSC). The TDC describes the chronological arrangement of TTP values of an examination and displays for each time-step of the dynamic scan the relative frequency of voxels showing a peak-enhancement time equal to the respective time-step. The MSC displays the correlated averaged relative signal measured in the voxels from at each time-step of the TDC (Fig. 1A).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114999.g001Figure 1\nExample of a global perfusion event derived from DSC-MRI.\nA) The time-to-Peak (TTP)-distribution curve (TDC) describes the chronological arrangement of the relative amount of voxels showing their peak enhancement at a certain time step during the examination (grey solid lower line). In parallel the mean signal curve (MSC) (blue dotted upper line) for all voxels with the same TTP-value is displayed in relation to the TDC. Mind the characteristic double peak structure of the MSC that was always arranged around the main TDC-peak. The red vertical lines mark the estimated beginning (dotted) and end (solid) of the wash in and wash out phase, respectively. B) After extraction of irrelevant fluctuations in the mean signal curve (blue solid line) the residual components were used to define an arterio-venous transit interval (marked by vertical dotted and solid red lines). Within this interval a double Gaussian model was fitted to the main TDC-peak (gold solid line). C) In the last step of the analysis, based on the fitted double Gaussian model zf-scores were computed and the time points (marked by vertical lines) for integer scores of zf = −/+3 (green dashed lines), −/+2 (red dashed lines), −/+1 (black dashed lines) and 0 (orange dashed – extended line) were estimated. These zf-scores, which were derived from the fitted model, served then to create vascularity maps, which allowed a differentiation between large arteries and veins as well as parenchymal vessels without any a priori defined absolute time thresholds.\n\nFurther assessment was performed using the software packages R (version 3.0.1) and SPM8 (Statistical Parameter Mapping 8, UCL-Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) [19]. The MSC was smoothed using normal mixture modeling for model-based clustering and was used only to estimate the time points for the arrival of the contrast bolus in the skull and the end of the first pass [20]. The time of the bolus arrival was assumed when the MSC exceeded the pre-contrast base line threshold (meanBL+2.5*SDBL; SD … standard deviation) for at least 2 s, while the end of its first pass was set at the time point, when the MSC-signal level fell below approx. one third of the MSC-peak signal to a distinguishable local minimum or the end of the scan was reached. Then the TDC was fitted to a double-Gaussian model within this interval using finite mixture modeling that incorporated the expectation-maximization algorithm (Fig. 1B) [21]. The double-Gaussian model was chosen assuming at least to different vessel components with an early fast filling arterial and a late slower filling venous phase. In this model parenchymal voxels were expected to be represented as a mixture of these two major components in the middle of the TDC main-peak. Means, SDs and probability weights provided by the model were used to derive a standard normal distribution based zf-score for each TDC time point or TTP-value, respectively, where the probability weights correspond to the proportional probability of the respective fitted single Gaussian curve in the model. The distribution function  of the normal distribution served to calculate quantiles for each TDC time point according to the model (equation 1):(1)where TTP applies to a given time point in the TDC and µ, σ and p are the mean, SD and probability weight of the respective Gaussian sub-function in the model. Since double Gaussian fitting was performed the maximum value for n was 2. Thereafter, standard normal distribution based zf-scores were calculated for  using the R built-in approximation algorithm AS 241 for estimation of quantiles of the normal distribution [22]. Thus a distinct zf-score could be assigned to each TTP-value and vascularity maps containing the voxels (v) in the following three time intervals: Ia = {v |−2 ≤ zf(TTPv) <−1}, Ip = {v |−1 ≤ zf(TTPv) ≤ +1}, Iv = {v |+1< zf(TTPv) ≤+2} were generated, where zf means the generic z-score according to the applied model that corresponds to the individual TTP-value measured in a certain voxel v.\n\nIndividual Threshold Calculation and Statistical Analysis\nIn a second step TTP-values corresponding to zf = −3, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, +3 were computed iteratively (Fig. 1C) and the interval durations between these limits were calculated as: ΔIa = TTP(−1) −TTP(−2), ΔIp =  TTP(+1) −TTP(−1) and ΔIv = TTP(+2) −TTP(+1). Where, more formally TTP(zf) corresponds to f−1(Φ(zf)), with f−1 being the inverse of the distribution function Φ(zf) of the fitted model.\nAbout ∼65% of all voxels of the total intracranial volume were found to represent brain parenchyma in space defining analysis (probability level >0.9) using SPM8. Since the TDC displays parenchymal voxels around the top of the main-peak and, according to the applied model, the TDC interval Ιp with zf-limits: −/+1 includes 68.27% of all voxels, the interval Ιp should describe the parenchymal bolus transit best. Consequently its duration ΔΙp can be interpreted as a measure of the individual regular perfusion threshold, as this should be the maximum delay possible for regularly perfused parenchyma.\nAll individual vascularity maps were then coregistered to the corresponding anatomical MR-images and spatial normalization to MNI-standard space, as provided by SPM8, was performed. Cumulative vascularity maps showing the probability of each voxel to belong to either of the intervals were generated for measurements with short and long TRs (Figs. 2 and 3), to test for the ability of the described method to identify parenchymal perfusion.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114999.g002Figure 2\nCumulative vascularity maps (n = 54; TR = 689 ms) of zf-intervals.\nRow A: Ιa = {v | −2≤zf(TTPv) <−1}, row B: Ιp = {v |−1≤zf(TTPv) ≤+1} and row C: Ιv = {v |+1 <zf(TTPv) ≤+2}. Using the proposed zf-intervals regions containing mainly arterial vessels (maps in row A), regions containing mainly capillary and small cerebral vessels (maps in row B), and regions mainly containing veins and sinuses (maps in row C), could be easily differentiated. Note, that the interval durations for the different maps were solely derived from the global TTP-distribution, which could be used for individual adjustments of vessel segment specific thresholds. An excellent agreement (shown in green – white colors) between the different exams could be demonstrated, especially for the parenchyma. Anatomical variability between patients, which is expected to be greater concerning the individual shape of the arterial and venous vessel tree, as well as the known technical limitations of echo planar imaging are precluding a 100%-match of the zf-score based compartment-classification in the tested samples.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114999.g003Figure 3\nCumulative vascularity maps (n = 7; TR = 1030 ms) of zf-intervals.\nrow A: Ιa = {v |−2≤zf(TTPv) <−1}, row B: Ιp = {v |−1≤zf(TTPv) ≤+1} and row C: Ιv = {v |+1 <zf(TTPv) ≤+2} (same as Fig. 2). Using the proposed zf-intervals, independently of the clearly longer TR, regions mainly containing arterial vessels (maps in row A), regions containing capillary and small cerebral vessels (maps in row B), and regions mainly containing veins and sinuses (maps in row C), could be readily distinguished from each other. (Note that due to the smaller number of patients in this group the maps appear less homogeneous and more noisy than those in Fig. 2.)\n\nFinally, quality of fitting was controlled by calculation of R2 between the respective TDC and the associated fitted model curve (fTDC) as (equation 2):(2)where  is the mean of the observed data, and TDCt and fTDCt are the TDC- and fitted-TDC-values at a certain time point t.\nGenerally, descriptive statistics for interval scaled data, also performed in R-statistics, were computed as median, minimum, maximum as well as 5%- and 95%-percentiles for time based data, otherwise mean, SD or/and confidence intervals are quoted. Group-level correlations were tested using Spearmen rank-correlation tests.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090017/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139814","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nEmbryo cryopreservation remains an important technique to enhance the reconstitution and distribution of animal populations with high genetic merit. One of the major detrimental factors to this technique is the damage caused by oxidative stress. Melatonin is widely known as an antioxidant with multi-faceted ways to counteract the oxidative stress. In this paper, we investigated the role of melatonin in protecting rabbit embryos during preimplantation development from the potential harmful effects of oxidative stress induced by in vitro culture or vitrification. Rabbit embryos at morula stages were cultured for 2 hr with 0 or 10−3 M melatonin (C or M groups). Embryos of each group were either transferred to fresh culture media (CF and MF groups) or vitrified/devitrified (CV and MV groups), then cultured in vitro for 48 hr until the blastocyst stage. The culture media were used to measure the activity of antioxidant enzymes: glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the levels of two oxidative substrates: lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO). The blastocysts from each group were used to measure the expression of developmental-related genes (GJA1, POU5F1 and Nanog) and oxidative-stress-response-related genes (NFE2L2, SOD1 and GPX1). The data showed that melatonin promoted significantly (P<0.05) the blastocyst rate by 17% and 12% in MF and MV groups compared to their controls (CF and CV groups). The GST and SOD activity significantly increased by the treatment of melatonin in fresh or vitrified embryos, while the levels of LPO and NO decreased (P<0.05). Additionally, melatonin considerably stimulated the relative expression of GJA1, NFE2L2 and SOD1 genes in MF and MV embryos compared to CF group. Furthermore, melatonin significantly ameliorated the reduction of POU5F1 and GPX1 expression induced by vitrification. The results obtained from the current investigation provide new and clear molecular aspects regarding the mechanisms by which melatonin promotes development of both fresh and vitrified rabbit embryos.\n"],"title":"Antioxidant Capacity of Melatonin on Preimplantation Development of Fresh and Vitrified Rabbit Embryos: Morphological and Molecular Aspects","materials_and_methods":["\nChemicals\nExcept when mentioned specifically, melatonin and other experimental reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (S.A., Egypt).\n\nAnimals and ethics statement\nA total of 30 nulliparous rabbit does and 10 bucks belonging to the Red Baladi breed [45] were purchased from the rabbit farm stations of Animal Production Research Institute (APRI, Cairo, Egypt). All does and bucks were housed during the study period in a semi-closed rabbitry housing system (Agricultural Experiment Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University) and kept in batteries of individual cages (60x50x35 cm), supplied with feeding hoppers made of galvanized steel sheets and nipples for automatic drinker. They were maintained under the same standard environmental conditions with light alternating on a cycle of 16 light hours and 8 dark hours, fed with the same commercial diet (18.4% CP, 3.1% ether extract, 12.7% crude fibre and 2.600 kcal DE/kg) and had free access to water. All the experimental protocols were approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University.\n\nEmbryo recovery\nFemales were synchronized for the receptivity by an intramuscular injection with 20 IU eCG (Folligon, Intervet, Netherland) 60 hr before insemination. Does were inseminated with semen from adult males of the same breed as described by Lavara et al. [46]. Seventy two hours later, does were sacrificed by intravenous injection of a 1% solution of sodium thiobarbital and embryos were immediately collected by uterine flushing at room temperature (20–25°C). Flushing media consisted of DPBSCa (0.132 g calcium chloride/ 1 liter of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline), supplemented with 2 g Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 10 ml antibiotics (10,000 units penicillin-G and 10 mg streptomycin per ml, penicillin-streptomycin solution 100X, BioShop Canada Inc.).\n\nTreatments and embryo culture\nOnly normal recovered embryos (compact morula with intact mucin coat and zona pellucida) from each female were cultured in vitro for 2 hr in a one-well embryo culture dish (NUNC A/S, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Roskilde Site, Denmark), containing 3 ml culture media (TCM199 + 20% fetal bovine serum + 1% antibiotics) supplemented with 10−3 M of melatonin (M) or without melatonin supplementation to serve as control (C). Afterwards, embryos of each group were either transferred to fresh culture media and collected as fresh blastocysts (CF and MF groups), or directly vitrified/devitrified according to the methodology previously described by Mehaisen et al. [5] and cultured in vitro until blastocyst stage (CV and MV groups). Embryo culture was conducted in a 4-well embryo culture dish (10 embryos per well contained 1 ml of culture media; NUNC A/S, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Roskilde Site, Denmark) at 38.5°C, 5% CO2 and saturated humidity. Following 48 hr in culture media, the developmental ability of each group was calculated as the percentage of embryos that reached either the hatched or expanded blastocyst stages. Thereafter, developed blastocysts from each group were directly collected for evaluating gene expression profile, while the remaining culture media were used for measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of oxidative substrates released by the embryos.\n\nAntioxidant enzymes activity and oxidative substrates levels\nAfter embryo culture, 4 samples of culture media, 1 ml each, from each group were immediately frozen at -20°C for later analysis. The activity of two antioxidant enzymes: glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as levels of two oxidative substrates: lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO), were analyzed using colorimetric assay kits (K263-100 for GST, K335-100 for SOD, K739-100 for LPO and K262-200 for NO; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, USA). The standard curves and calculations were performed following the kits protocol for each analysis then all values were related to the number of embryos developed to blastocyst stage in each sample.\nThe activity of GST enzyme was determined according to methods described by Habig et al. [47]. Briefly, 50 μl of each sample was added to 55 μl reaction mixture contained 49 μl GST assay buffer (pH 6.5), 1 μl 1-chloro–2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) solution and 5 μl glutathione (GSH). The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 5 min using automatic scanning spectrophotometer. The SOD enzyme activity was assayed by monitoring the inhibition of photochemical reduction of xanthine oxidase (XO) according Beyer and Fridovich [48] approach. In brief, Samples of 20 μl were mixed with 200 μl of WST–1 working solution and 20 μl of enzyme working solution then incubated at 37°C for 20 min. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to cause 50% inhibition of the reduction of XO as monitored at 450 nm.\nThe LPO levels were determined by measuring the level of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) according to methods described by Farombi et al. [49] with modification. Briefly, 10 μl of sample was mixed with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 0.01 ml 5% (w/v) butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT) and 500 μl of 0.75% TBA in 0.1 M HCl. The mixture was heated at 95°C for 60 min and after cooling centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g. The absorbance of Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the supernatant was determined using an automatic scanning spectrophotometer at 532 nm. The levels of NO were detected by colorimetric analysis in a simple two-step process [50]. In the first step, 85 μl of the sample was mixed with 5 μl of the Nitrate Reductase and 5 μl of the enzyme cofactor then incubated at room temperature for 1 hr to convert nitrate to nitrite. In the second step, 5 μl of the enhancer was added to each sample and incubated for 10 min, followed by 50 μl Griess Reagent R1 (containing phosphoric acid) and 50 μl Griess Reagent R2 (containing NED, N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride). The azochromophore color amount developed from the last step was detected using automatic scanning spectrophotometer at 540 nm.\n\nRNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR\nAt the end of embryo culture, 30 blastocysts from each group (three replicates, 10 embryos each) were transferred from culture media into cryogenic vials (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) and directly plunged into liquid nitrogen (LN2) for later analysis. Total RNA isolation was performed using the Arcturs® PicoPure® RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) per manufacturer's instruction. Genomic DNA contamination was removed by performing column DNA digestion using RNase-free DNase (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted in 11 μl of elution buffer. The RNA from each replicate was reverse transcribed using 1 mM oligo (dT) primers and the Rever-AidcDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Heidelberg, Germany) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Sequence-specific primers (Table 1) for the real-time PCR were designed using the Primer-blast web interface (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi) and each pair of primers was tested to achieve efficiencies close to 1.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0139814.t001\nTable 1 Details of primers used for real-time PCR quantitative analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene symbol\nGene full name\nGenBank accession number\nPrimer sequences\nAnnealing temperature (°C)\nProduct size (bp)\n\n\n\n\nGJA1\nGap Junction Protein, Alpha 1\nNM_001198948\nF:atgagcagtctgcctttcgt\n55\n228\n\n\n\n\n\nR:cgttgacaccatcagtttgg\n\n\n\n\nPOU5F1\nPOU Class 5 Homeobox 1\nNM_001099957\nF:gagatttgcaaagcggagac\n55\n188\n\n\n\n\n\nR:cggttacagaaccacacacg\n\n\n\n\nNanog\nNanog Homeobox\nXM_002712762\nF:gccagtcgtggagtaaccat\n55\n196\n\n\n\n\n\nR:tgtgctgtgttctggctttc\n\n\n\n\nNFE2L2\nNuclear Factor, Erythroid 2-Like 2\nXM_002712305\nF:tgaaatcctcccaattcagc\n55\n228\n\n\n\n\n\nR:gtgaagactgggctctcgac\n\n\n\n\nSOD1\nSuperoxide Dismutase 1\nNM_001082627\nF:cacttcgagcagaagggaac\n54\n184\n\n\n\n\n\nR:cgtgcctctcttcatccttc\n\n\n\n\nGPX1\nGlutathione Peroxidase 1\nNM_001085444\nF:gcttcgagaagttcctggtg\n53\n218\n\n\n\n\n\nR:gcgttcctccatttgttttc\n\n\n\n\nGAPDH\nGlyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase\nNM_001082253\nF:aggtcatccacgaccacttc\n57\n202\n\n\n\n\n\nR:gtgagtttcccgttcagctc\n\n\n\n\nH2A\nHistone H2A.

The thermal cycling parameter was set to 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. After the end of the last cycle, melting curve was generated by starting the fluorescence acquisition at 60°C and taking measurements every 7 s interval until the temperature reached 95°C (S1 Fig).

A generalized linear model was performed using a binary probit model with binomial distribution to analyze differences in the in vitro development rates in embryo groups (CF, CV, MF and MV). One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical differences in antioxidant enzymatic activity between embryo groups followed by a multiple pair wise comparison (Duncan’s test). Gene expression data between embryo groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by a multiple pairwise comparison using t-tests.

The present study used a psychometric instrument to determine whether there is a psychological burden on patients due to referral to secondary eye care, and used Rasch analysis to convert the data from an ordinal to an interval scale. Design: Cross sectional study. Participants and Controls: 322 participants and 80 control participants. Methods: State (i.e. current) and trait (i.e. propensity to) anxiety were measured in a group of patients referred to a hospital eye department in the UK and in a control group who have had a sight test but were not referred. Response category analysis plus infit and outfit Rasch statistics and person separation indices were used to determine the usefulness of individual items and the response categories. Principal components analysis was used to determine dimensionality. Main Outcome Measure: Levels of state and trait anxiety measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: State anxiety scores were significantly higher in the patients referred to secondary eye care than the controls (p<0.04), but similar for trait anxiety (p>0.1). Rasch analysis highlighted that the questionnaire results needed to be split into “anxiety-absent” and “anxiety-present” items for both state and trait anxiety, but both subscales showed the same profile of results between patients and controls. Conclusions: State anxiety was shown to be higher in patients referred to secondary eye care than the controls, and at similar levels to people with moderate to high perceived susceptibility to breast cancer. This suggests that referral from primary to secondary eye care can result in a significant psychological burden on some patients. "],"title":"Levels of State and Trait Anxiety in Patients Referred to Ophthalmology by Primary Care Clinicians: A Cross Sectional Study","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nThe study complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was given by the Bradford NHS Research Ethics Committee (Reference 07/Q1202/41). Eligible participants (identified using the hospital booking system) were new patients who had an outpatient appointment booked at Bradford Royal Infirmary Eye Service between January 2008 and December 2008. All eligible patients (1,854 patients) were sent a covering letter, an information sheet, contact details of the research team and a coded STAI questionnaire. The covering letter asked the patient to read the information sheet and, if they consented to participate, to complete the questionnaire on the day of their appointment and hand the completed questionnaires to the doctor or nurse who examined them on the day of their appointment. This was accepted as implied written consent by the ethics committee as it meant that no patient identifiable data had to be sent via post. No children participated in the study.\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria for the referred cohort included an initial referral from a GP or optometrist to the hospital eye service within the proposed testing schedule of the study, and aged over 16. Exclusion criteria included patients who were already hospital patients and had been called back for review or requiring further investigation.\n\nMeasures\nThe STAI contains 40 items, 20 aimed at State anxiety (current level of anxiety), followed by 20 for Trait anxiety (propensity for the patient to be anxious). 21 of the items are anxiety-present items (e.g. “I feel nervous and restless”) and 19 are anxiety-absent items (e.g. “I feel pleasant”). Items are scored on a four point Likert scale, scored 1–4, with the anxiety-absent items being reverse scored.\n\nProcedure\nThe information was sent to arrive by post at least 24 hours in advance of their appointment at the hospital. If the patients read the information and subsequently consented to participate they were requested to bring the anonymized but coded questionnaires on the day of their appointment. The consenting patients were asked to complete the questionnaire, which should have taken about 10 minutes, while they were waiting for their appointment and if they wished to complete them at the hospital a private room was available. When the participants were called for their appointment they were asked to hand the completed questionnaires, in the sealed envelope provided, to the clinician to be passed on to the researcher. Identifying codes were used, to anonymize patients’ responses. Codes were cross-referenced at a later stage to unite questionnaire and patient demographic data.\n\nControl Group\nIn order to determine whether hospital patients had raised levels of psychological distress, the level of distress in a control group also had to be determined. The most suitable control group was patients that had an eye examination in primary care but had not been referred. Local optometric practices were approached via a Local Optical Committee meeting and invited to recruit patients on our behalf. Seven optometry practices agreed to participate. The optometrists asked all patients within the inclusion criteria (over 16 years of age and not needing referral to secondary eye care) if they would participate in the study and those who were interested were given information sheets and the questionnaires.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nSPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 17.0 (Chicago: SPSS Inc.) was used to perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality of the data distribution. Where appropriate, non-parametric statistical analyses were used to detect the significance of any differences between groups. Rasch analysis using Winsteps 3.66 was used to assess individual items in terms of their fit to the Rasch model using mean square fit statistics (infit and outfit). Items with fit statistics greater than 1 demonstrate more variation from the predicted model and if too high may be unreliable or measure a different trait to the rest of the scale. Conversely, items with fit statistics less than 1 lack variance from the model and if too low are too predictable meaning they may not help discriminate between participants. The present study identified misfitting items if their infit or outfit values were outside the range 0.7 to 1.3 [21]–[23]. Misfitting items were removed and the analysis run again to determine the effect it had on the participant discrimination (as measured by the Participant Separation Index, PSI). The distribution of responses to the categories of each item was assessed i.e. floor and ceiling effects, and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the residuals was performed to determine the dimensionality of the STAI.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065708/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139813/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000453/title","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152135/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152135/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/abstract","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/references","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/body","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/introduction","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006711/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Introduction: The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used in many countries to prioritize organ allocation for the majority of patients who require orthotopic liver transplantation. This score is calculated based on the following laboratory parameters: creatinine, bilirubin and the international normalized ratio (INR). Consequently, high measurement accuracy is essential for equitable and fair organ allocation. For serum creatinine measurements, the Jaffé method and enzymatic detection are well-established routine diagnostic tests. Methods: A total of 1,013 samples from 445 patients on the waiting list or in evaluation for liver transplantation were measured using both creatinine methods from November 2012 to September 2013 at the university hospital Leipzig, Germany. The measurements were performed in parallel according to the manufacturer’s instructions after the samples arrived at the institute of laboratory medicine. Patients who had required renal replacement therapy twice in the previous week were excluded from analyses. Results: Despite the good correlation between the results of both creatinine quantification methods, relevant differences were observed, which led to different MELD scores. The Jaffé measurement led to greater MELD score in 163/1,013 (16.1%) samples with differences of up to 4 points in one patient, whereas differences of up to 2 points were identified in 15/1,013 (1.5%) samples using the enzymatic assay. Overall, 50/152 (32.9%) patients with MELD scores >20 had higher scores when the Jaffé method was used. Discussion: Using the Jaffé method to measure creatinine levels in samples from patients who require liver transplantation may lead to a systematic preference in organ allocation. In this study, the differences were particularly pronounced in samples with MELD scores >20, which has clinical relevance in the context of urgency of transplantation. These data suggest that official recommendations are needed to determine which laboratory diagnostic methods should be used when calculating MELD scores.

A total of 1,075 samples from 455 patients were available for creatinine measurements using both methods in parallel on the same day of blood taking without any freezing or storing steps before analysis. Creatinine and bilirubin determinations were performed using Cobas 6000 and 8000 analyzers (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Creatinine was measured using the enzymatic assay creatinine Plus Ver. 2 and the creatinine Jaffé Gen. 2 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).Bilirubin was measured using the Bilirubin Total DPD Gen.2 kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The prothrombin assay was performed to determine the INR using an ACL TOP 700 System (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, USA) with the RecombiPlasTin 2G kit (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, USA).All samples were taken from patients on waiting list or from candidates for liver transplantation at University Hospital Leipzig, Germany.Measurements and MELD diagnostics were performed for routine diagnostics and for reporting to the transplantation organization according to the clinical situation of the patient and the indication was independent of this study. The additional measurements with an additional creatinine method were done for evaluation of the influences on the MELD-score and were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Leipzig. No additional samples for the study were taken. After anonymization of the patients the data from the laboratory information system was analyzed retrospectively. In an additional consultation with the Head of the Ethics Committee of the University Leipzig, it was approved that in this type of retrospective data analysis an additional patient consent was not required.The MELD scores were calculated from the serum creatinine (mg/dL), serum bilirubin (mg/dL) and prothrombin time (INR) values according to the applicable specifications using the following formula:According to the regulations of the Permanent Commission for Organ Transplantation in Germany, creatinine (mg/dL), bilirubin (mg/dL) and INR values that were lower than 1.0 were set to 1.0 for the MELD calculation. The maximum serum creatinine level was set to 4.0 mg/dL = 353.7 µmol/L. Similarly, the maximum creatinine level in dialysis patients was set to 4.0 mg/dL = 353.7 µmol/L. Creatinine values <1.0 mg/dL were set to 1.0 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L [9].\nStatistics\nData that were obtained from the bilirubin, creatinine and INR assays were analyzed using Excel 14.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA) and SPSS 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, USA). Pearson’s correlation analysis (bivariate, two-tailed) or a partial correlation analysis (two-tailed) was used to identify any correlations between the parameters. The differences in the mean values were calculated using the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. A p value <0.5 was considered statistically significant. The level of agreement between Jaffé und enzymatic creatinine measurements was evaluated according to Bland and Altman [10].\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090015/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053119","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Psoriasin (S100A7), a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, is highly expressed in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and in the benign hyperproliferative skin disorder psoriasis. The gene that encodes psoriasin and many other S100 genes are located within a gene cluster on chromosome region 1q21, known as the epidermal differentiation complex. This cluster contains genes for several differentiation markers that play important roles in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of psoriasin in the differentiation process of mammary epithelial cells. Normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) cultured in confluence and suspension, conditions known to induce psoriasin expression, demonstrated a shift towards a more differentiated phenotype indicated by an increase in the expression of the luminal differentiation markers CD24 and MUC1 and the reduced expression of the breast stem cell marker CD44. The expression of psoriasin and MUC1 was most pronounced in the CD24+-enriched fraction of confluent MCF10A cells. The shift towards a more differentiated phenotype was abolished upon the downregulation of psoriasin using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Using specific inhibitors, we showed that psoriasin and CD24 expression was regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways. While immunohistochemical analyses of DCIS showed heterogeneity, the expression of psoriasin and CD24 showed a similar staining pattern. Our findings suggest that the expression of psoriasin is linked to the luminal differentiation marker CD24 in mammary epithelial cells. Psoriasin demonstrated an essential role in the shift towards a more differentiated CD24+ phenotype, supporting the hypothesis that psoriasin plays a role in the differentiation of luminal mammary epithelial cells.\n      "],"title":"The Expression of Psoriasin (S100A7) and CD24 Is Linked and Related to the Differentiation of Mammary Epithelial Cells","materials_and_methods":["\n        Ethics statement\n        The study was performed under conditions approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

The study was submitted to the local Institutional Review board and complied with institutional guidelines. Immunohistochemical stains were created from paraffin blocks in a strictly anonymized fashion, therefore a written consent was not mandatory. Instead, patients gave their verbal informed consent which was documented in the referral. The consent procedure was approved by the ethics committee.\n      \n        Cell lines and culture conditions\n        The normal immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured as previously described [4]. The establishment of stable clones with downregulated psoriasin expression was made by transfecting MCF10A with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against human psoriasin, as previously described [19], [20]. Transient downregulation of psoriasin expression was accomplished by transfecting MCF10A cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against psoriasin (sc-106459, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

We derived a theoretical current-voltage relationship for pores in lipid membranes that describes the experimental data very well when assuming an asymmetric membrane.

In all experiments shown here, we used a DMPC∶DLPC = 10∶1 mol/mol mixture. The 150 mM NaCl electrolyte solutions used for the patch clamp experiments were buffered with 2 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 1 mM disodium EDTA (Fluka, Switzerland). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. The specific conductivity of the solution was measured to be 1.412 S/m at 21°C. In order to get rid of dust particles and other possible contaminants, the buffer was always pressed through a sterile 0.2 m filter (Minisart® #16532, Sartorius Stedim Biotech, France) immediately before use. All chemicals used were of the highest purity grade available and any water used was purified (resistivity 18 Mcm) on a desktop EASYpure RF water purification system from Barnstead/Thermolyne (Dubuque/IA, USA).Each lipid type was dissolved separately in an organic solvent (dichloromethane ∶ methanol = 2∶1). The two components were then mixed in the desired ratio. This mixture was dried by gentle heating while being exposed to an air stream. The remaining organic solvent was then removed by placing the sample in a high vacuum desiccator for a couple of hours. The resulting lipid film was then resuspended by adding a highly volatile solvent (hexane∶ethanol 4∶1 by volume). The final lipid concentration in the solvent was 1–2 mM.Electrophysiological measurements were performed on single synthetic membranes spanned over the tip of a patch pipette using the tip-dipping method [35]. In this method, the planar lipid bilayer membrane is formed on the tip of a patch-clamp glass pipette that has been filled with electrolyte solution. The tip is in contact with the surface of a beaker filled with the same electrolyte solution. The lipid solution in the hexane/ethanol mixture is then brought into contact with the outer surface of the glass pipette. When the solution flows down the pipette, a membrane spontaneously forms at the tip of the pipette. The solvent was allowed to evaporate for at least 30 seconds before the pipette was lowered 45 mm below the bath surface. The main advantage of this method is that the resulting membrane is practically solvent free.The patch diameter was 1 m. Pipettes were pulled from 1.5 mm/0.84 mm (outer diameter/inner diameter) borosilicate glass capillaries (#1B150F-3, World Precision Instruments, USA) with a vertical PC-10 puller from Narishige Group, Japan. Current recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City/CA, USA). The pipette and electrodes were mounted on a cooled capacitor feed- back integrating headstage amplifier (Headstage CV 203BU, Axon Instruments Inc.). The same experimental procedure was used and described in [28].Channel kinetics has been determined by defining a suitable threshold for an open event in an automated procedure. The threshold was set to be , where  is the noise of the baseline current. The method is described in more detail in the PhD thesis of one of the authors [36]. Somewhat more sophisticated methods to bin the kinetic data in a logarithmic manner can be found in [37]–[39].The patch-pipette experiments have the advantage over black lipid membrane experiments that they result in much more stable and consistent conductance traces, and the membranes don't rupture so easily. However, due to the small patch size, there seems to be a large influence of the pipette on the membranes. Newly formed membranes over fresh pipettes lead to somewhat varying quantitative results. The voltage dependence of our membranes was therefore always recorded for one unique membrane and one pipette. While trends and qualitative behavior are reproducible between different experiments, the absolute numbers vary (see [28] for more details)."]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065707/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003546/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003546/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040814/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127450/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127450/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127450/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127450/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","abstract":["\nUnderstanding complex networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is one of the foremost challenges of the post-genomic era. Due to the recent advances in experimental bio-technology, including yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H), tandem affinity purification (TAP) and other high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection, huge amounts of PPI network data are becoming available. Of major concern, however, are the levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, for Y2H screens, it is thought that the false positive rate could be as high as 64%, and the false negative rate may range from 43% to 71%. TAP experiments are believed to have comparable levels of noise.\nWe present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. We use it for predicting new interactions and thus for guiding future biological experiments. This technique is the first to utilize currently the best fitting network model for PPI networks, geometric graphs. Our approach achieves specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. We use it to assign confidence scores to physical protein-protein interactions in the human PPI network downloaded from BioGRID. Using our approach, we predict 251 interactions in the human PPI network, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common GO terms. Moreover, we validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available from the web site: http://www.kuchaev.com/Denoising.\nAuthor Summary: Proteins are responsible for much of the biological ‘heavy lifting’ that keeps our cells functioning. However, proteins don't usually work alone; instead they typically bind together to form geometrically and chemically complex structures that are tailored for a specific task. Experimental techniques allow us to detect whether two types of proteins are capable of binding together, or ‘interacting’. This creates a network where two proteins are connected if they have been seen to interact, just as we could regard two people as being connected if they are linked on Facebook. Such protein-protein interaction networks have been developed for several organisms, using a range of methods, all of which are subject to experimental errors. These network data reveal a fascinating and intricate pattern of connections. In particular, it is known that proteins can be arranged into a low-dimensional space, such as a three-dimensional cube, so that interacting proteins are close together. Our work shows that this structure can be exploited to assign confidence levels to recorded protein-protein interactions and predict new interactions that were overlooked experimentally. In tests, we predicted 251 new human protein-protein interactions, and through literature curation we independently validated a statistically significant number of them. "],"title":"Geometric De-noising of Protein-Protein Interaction Networks","materials_and_methods":["\nOverview\nA graph , where  is a set of nodes and  is a set of edges, is called connected if for all pairs of nodes  there is a path between them comprised of edges from . Real PPI networks are not connected, but they usually have one large connected component, which includes most (about 90%) of the network's nodes and edges. For example, the human PPI network obtained from BioGRID (version 2.0.35) [13] has 7,930 proteins with 7,513 of them belonging to the largest connected component. In this paper, we use only the largest connected component, since embedding disconnected components of a graph into space may result in meaningless spatial overlap. Intuitively, it is difficult to see how any algorithm that uses PPI data alone could infer links between members of disconnected components. Hence, in particular, we are not aiming to predict new interactions between members of disconnected components.\nWe embed the largest connected component of a PPI network into low dimensional space, and compute spatial distances between the embedded nodes. Some nodes are very close in the projection space compared to the average distance between pairs of nodes that are recorded as interacting (true positives obtained from the high-confidence data set). Also, some nodes are far apart compared to the average distance between pairs of nodes that are known, with a certain confidence, not to interact (true negatives). Pairs of nodes that are unusually close to each other, but are not connected in the PPI network, are good candidates for false negatives. On the other hand, pairs of nodes that are connected in the PPI network, but are unusually far apart in the embedding space, are strong candidates for false positives. These are the principles on which we develop our algorithm.\n\nThe Embedding Algorithm\nWe briefly describe our embedding algorithm. It is based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [25]. Note that MDS is a spectral method, based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and in this sense it is similar to algorithms that use the Fiedler vector from the graph Laplacian [26]. However, there is a key difference in the way in which pairwise weights between nodes are interpreted. MDS regards a larger pairwise weight between nodes as an indication of more dissimilarity.\nGiven pairwise Euclidean distances  between all pairs of  elements in a set, the task is to find locations in m-dimensional Euclidean space (vectors  in ) for these elements so that pairwise distances are preserved, i.e.,  for all . This is not possible, in general, for a given dimension , and therefore we want to find the best approximation. If the distance information data respects the triangle inequality, double centering gives the symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix ,(1)It may be shown that(2)where  is the matrix whose  column is . The matrix  has the real Schur decomposition [27] , where  is orthogonal and . Rows of  are the eigenvectors of  and diagonal entries in  are the eigenvalues of  ordered high-to-low. The solution  in equation (2) may be computed as .\nAn embedding into  space is found by truncating to the largest  eigenvalues, giving(3)where  is the  row of . This is the optimal embedding into  dimensions in the sense that  is the closest matrix of rank at most  to the exact solution , in any orthogonally invariant norm [27].\nIn PPI networks, we only have {0,1} connectivity information, rather than Euclidean distances. This is why we use a function of the pathlength (the length of the shortest path between nodes in the network) in lieu of the Euclidean distance. Our experiments suggest that square root of the graph pathlength is a good function for this purpose. Thus, we use , where  denotes the pathlength between nodes  and . We also set an upper threshold on . This allows sparsity to be exploited for computational efficiency. Subspace iteration [27] is used to compute eigenpairs of the matrix  in equation (1). The algorithm typically requires only a few sparse matrix multiplications and the overall complexity is less than the  cost of computing pairwise distances between nodes in the new embedding, where  is the number of nodes. For practical details about the algorithm, see [18].\n\nGeometric De-noising of PPI Networks\nOur de-noising approach exploits the fact that high quality PPI networks are well modeled by geometric graphs [16]–[18]. The basic version of our de-noising procedure consists of the following steps:\n\nAlgorithm 1\n\nEmbed a PPI network into Euclidean space of dimension .\n\nChoose a threshold .\n\nFind all “non-edges” (pairs of nodes corresponding to proteins that are not interacting in the PPI network) with Euclidean distance between their embedding . These are our new predicted PPIs (edges).\n\nThis procedure may be iterated in the sense that we can add our predictions to the network and re-embed to produce new predictions. In all our experiments for any dimension, this process converged after very few iterations. We used this procedure to test our approach (see section “Testing of geometric de-noising”).\nFor real applications, we use a slightly modified procedure in which rather than strictly classifying pairs of nodes into edges (interaction) and non-edges, we assign confidence scores to them reflecting the likelihood for the pairs of nodes to interact. In this manner, we learn the following two probability density functions from the data:  and , where  is the probability density function which describes the distribution of distances between pairs of proteins which are known to interact (i.e., form edges in the PPI networks) and  is the probability density function which describes the distribution of distances between pairs of proteins which are not interacting (non-edges in the PPI network). We learn  and  from the data given by the embedding step (see Figure 1 A and B). These densities are modeled as mixtures of three Gaussians and all parameters are learned from the data using the Expectation Maximization algorithm [28]:(4)\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454.g001Figure 1\nProbability density functions  and .\nProbability density functions  and  learned from embedding the largest connected components of the following PPI networks into 5-dimensional Euclidean space: (A) the yeast S. cerevisiae high confidence PPI network [11] (“Yhigh”); (B) the human PPI network from BioGRID (version 2.0.35) [13] (“HumanBG”). The  represents the values of the Euclidean distances between pairs of nodes in the embedding; the  represents the values of probability density functions  and .\n\nThe density of the distribution  is computed using formula (5) below over all pairs of proteins for which interaction is not known to exist. Note that since the fraction of the real interaction is orders of magnitude lower than the possible number of protein pairs in the network [29], unknown interactions will not have significant effect on this density(5)\nThese are the linear combinations of three Gaussian distributions with means  and variances  for edges and  and  for non edges. The number of mixtures in models (4) and (5) was selected to be 3, since we observed that the histograms corresponding to the densities  and  had no more than 3 modes in all of our experiments.\nNote that both distributions presented in Figure 1 A and B are bi-modal. Therefore, posteriors  and  will also be bi-modal (see Figure S1 and Figure S2). This low modality comes comes from the fact that these PPI networks are well modeled even by 2-dimensional geometric random graphs. Intuitively, the smaller the distance between two proteins, the higher the likelihood for them to interact. This is reflected by confidence scores (formula 6), which take into account  and  simultaneously and monotonically increase when distance between two proteins decreases (Figure S3).\nOur modified procedure may be summarized as follows:\n\nAlgorithm 2\n\n1 Embed PPI network into Euclidean space of dimension .\n\n2 Learn probabilistic densities  and  from coordinates of node embedding points in the space.\n\n3 Choose some threshold .\n\n4 For each pair of nodes with  compute its confidence score ().\n\nThe confidence score for the pair of nodes  is computed as(6)where  is the distance between points corresponding to nodes  and  in the embedding and  if  is an edge in the PPI network and . This score is proportional to the likelihood of a pair of nodes to form an edge if all noise that prevents the current PPI network from being a geometric graph is removed.\nUsing Bayes' rule we compute posterior densities  and :(7)(8)where  is a prior belief about what fraction of pairs of nodes in the PPI network are true interactions (edges). One can choose different priors to reflect existing knowledge about the density of a particular PPI network. We compute  as . The fraction of real edges among all possible node pairs in real PPI networks is very small. For example, it is estimated that among about 6,000 proteins in the yeast S.cerevisiae, there are only 30,000–75,000 interactions [29]–[31], which is a small portion of the maximum possible total of ≈17×106. The human PPI network is estimated to have 154,000–369,000 interactions among 20,000–25,000 proteins [29]. Thus, in reality  is very small, which helps us avoid many false positives in the network. We do not need to know , since it can be treated as a normalization constant.\nThe parameter  prevents us from assigning confidence scores (CS) to the pairs of nodes that are very far apart and thus are very unlikely to interact. Algorithm 2 could be reduced to Algorithm 1 by choosing an appropriate confidence score threshold value.\n\nData\nWe use two different datasets, one to test our approach and the other to provide a practical application of our method. Since the yeast PPI network described by Collins et al. [11] is believed to be of high confidence, we use it to test our approach. The high confidence part of this network consists of 9,074 interactions amongst 1,622 proteins and it is not connected. We take its largest connected component (henceforth denoted by “Yhigh”) which has 8,323 interactions between 1,004 proteins. We use low confidence edges of this network to verify our predictions, i.e., we try to “predict” these low confidence interactions. That is, by true positive, we mean an edge that is predicted by our method and present in the full network described by Collins et al. [11].

Neuroligin-2 is also present on the pancreatic beta-cell surface, and there it engages in transcellular interactions that drive functional maturation of the insulin secretory machinery; these are necessary for normal insulin secretion. The effects of neuroligin-2 deficiency on brain and neuronal function and morphology and on behavior and coordination have been extensively characterized using neuroligin-2 knockout mice. The effects of absent neuroligin-2 expression on islet development and function, however, are unknown. Here, to help test whether neuroligin-2 is necessary for normal islet development, we characterized islet morphology in mice lacking neuroligin-2. To test whether–as predicted by our earlier co-culture studies–absence of neuroligin-2 impairs beta cell function, we compared glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by islets from mutant and wild-type mice. Our results show that while islets from neuroligin-2-deficient mice do not to appear to differ architecturally from wild-type islets, they are smaller, fewer in number, and contain beta cells with lower insulin content. Evaluation of transcript levels suggests that upregulation of neuroligin-1 helps compensate for loss of neuroligin-2. Surprisingly, under both basal and stimulating glucose levels, isolated islets from the knockout mice secreted more of their intracellular insulin content. Rat islets with shRNA-mediated neuroligin-2 knockdown also exhibited increased insulin secretion. Neurexin transcript levels were lower in the knockout mice and, consistent with our prior finding that neurexin is a key constituent of the insulin granule docking machinery, insulin granule docking was reduced. These results indicate that neuroligin-2 is not necessary for the formation of pancreatic islets but that neuroligin-2 influences islet size and number. Neuroligin-2–perhaps through its effects on the expression and/or activity of its binding partner neurexin–promotes insulin granule docking, a known constraint on insulin secretion.\n"],"title":"Altered Pancreatic Islet Function and Morphology in Mice Lacking the Beta-Cell Surface Protein Neuroligin-2","materials_and_methods":["\nIslet Isolation and Culture\nNeuroligin-2 knockout mice were kindly provided by Frederique Varoqueaux (Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine). The generation of these mice has previously been described [11]. Experiments were performed using neuroligin-2 null (Nlgn2−/−) mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls generated by the breeding of heterozygous pairs. Islets were isolated from WT and neuroligin-2 knockout (KO) mice and also from Sprague-Dawley rats (240–260 g; Charles River Laboratories) using collagenase (Liberase, Roche) as previously described [13], [23], [24]. Islets were allowed to recover for 24 h in culture after isolation. Culture medium for islets was RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mм L-glutamine, 10 mм HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mм sodium pyruvate, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B.\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in full accordance with IACUC guidelines.\n\nImmunostaining\nIslets were washed 3 times with D-PBS and then incubated for 1 h in 10% buffered formalin solution. Islets were washed again 3 times with D-PBS, then transferred to a 2% melted agarose solution at 55°C and spun down immediately at 5000 rpm. Once the agarose was solidified, islets were embedded in paraffin (UCSD Moores Cancer Center histology core) and then sectioned. Intact pancreases were immersed in 10% buffered formalin for 1 h, paraffin-embedded and then sectioned.\nPrior to staining, pancreas sections and islets were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS-Tween (PBST). Sections were stained using a guinea-pig anti-insulin primary antibody (Dako; 1∶500 dilution) and an anti-glucagon monoclonal antibody (Sigma; 1∶500) in 1% BSA in PBST. After primary antibody incubation for 1 h, sections were washed with PBST then incubated with 1∶5000 Alexa 488 anti-guinea-pig IgG secondary antibody and 1∶5000 Alexa 594 anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (both from Life Technologies) in 1% BSA in PBST. Sections were washed again with PBST, incubated 5 min with 1∶5000 DAPI in 1% BSA in PBST, washed with PBST, and then mounting media and plastic coverslips were applied. Images were captured using an inverted Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope.\nFor automated whole-section imaging, slides were imaged using an Aperio Scanscope FL image capture device operated by the Sanford Burnham Medical Research Institute Histopathology Core. Images were converted into TIFF format and analyzed using ImagePro software (Media Cybernectics). For quantitative analysis, eight 5 µm sections spaced 80 µm apart from each pancreas were examined.\n\nBrightfield and EM Imaging\nFor brightfield imaging, isolated islets were washed 3 times with D-PBS to remove any cellular debris then imaged using an inverted Nikon Optiphot microscope. Brightfield images were analyzed using ImagePro to determine the apparent diameter of each islet, and islet cross-sectional areas were then calculated. Determination of the fraction of islets with alpha cells in the beta-cell core region was carried out as previously described [25].\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed as described previously [26]. Briefly, islets were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h. Islets were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h, stained en bloc in 1% uranyl acetate for 1 h and then dehydrated in ethanol. Next, samples were embedded in epoxy resin and cut into 60 nM sections stained with lead nitrate and uranyl acetate. Sections were imaged using JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope and images captured with a Gatan digital camera. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH) by operators blinded as to mouse identity.\n\nInsulin and Protein Content\nIsolated islets were washed 3 times with D-PBS then lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors as previously described [26]. Protein content of the lysate was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay and insulin content was determined by RIA (Millipore).\nTo determine pancreatic insulin content, pancreases were cut in half, dried, weighed and then placed into 1.5% HCl, 70% EtOH solution overnight at −20°C for insulin extraction. Tissue was then homogenized and incubated in the same solution overnight at −20°C. The tissue was then spun at 2000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant then neutralized with 1 M Tris pH 7.5. Insulin content was determined by RIA.\n\nAnalysis of Insulin Secretion\nStudies of insulin secretion in static culture were performed as previously described [26]. Briefly, pooled islets from three 12–13 wk old mice were washed twice with 2.75 mM glucose Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer and allowed to equilibrate for 45 min. Islets were then treated for 1 h with KRB buffer containing either 2.75 mM glucose or 16.75 mM glucose. Media was then collected and spun down at 2000 rpm to remove debris and insulin content determined by RIA (Millipore). Islet perifusion studies were performed by the University of Washington Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center Islet Cell and Functional Analysis Core as previously described [27]. Batches of 100 knockout and wild-type islets were loaded into parallel perifusion chambers and assessed simultaneously. The insulin content of the perifusate fractions and of representative samples of the perifused islets was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alpco). Insulin secretory rate (ISR) was calculated as the fraction of islet cellular insulin content released per minute. Insulin secretion during stated time intervals was assessed as integrated area under the curve (of ISR) during the time interval. Average areas under the curve were analyzed by 2-tailed Student’s t-test.\n\nshRNA Delivery\nFollowing a 24 h recovery period, isolated rat islets were infected with adenovirus vectors expressing shRNAs targeted against neuroligin-2 or, as a control, against a protein, Cav3, not expressed in rat islets (caveolin-3; absence of Cav3 message in rat islet RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, not shown), or they were left uninfected. The viral vector, its construction from the adenovirus shuttle plasmid pDelatE1Z, and the methods by which the adenoviral vectors were purified and titers measured have been described [28]. Islets were infected using 1.9×10?7 viral particles per islet. Following a 24 h infection period, the islets were cultured for 6 more days with daily media changes. The inserted sequence targeting neuroligin-2 was: GGAGCAAGTTCAACAGCAATTCAAGAGATTGCTGTTGAACTTGCTCC (the neuroligin-2 shRNA target sequence is underlined) and the control (Cav3 shRNA) insert sequence was: GACATTCACTGCAAGGAGATACTCGAGTATCTCCTTGCAGTGAATGTC.\n\nReal Time quantitative PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using the Genelute RNA prep kit (Sigma). Gene-specific primers (Table 1) were designed and then used to perform qPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Machine (Applied Biosystems). RNA samples from three wild-type and three knockout mice were analyzed in duplicate along with no-reverse transcriptase (no-RT) and water controls. Normalization of qPCR values was with values from parallel qPCR of 18S RNA. Primers were designed using Primer 3 software.

The crop is widely cultivated throughout Asia for the production of immature pods known as ‘long beans’ or ‘asparagus beans’. While the genome of cowpea ssp. unguiculata has been characterized recently by high-density genetic mapping and partial sequencing, little is known about the genome of asparagus bean. We report here the first genetic map of asparagus bean based on SNP and SSR markers.

The overall map length is 745 cM, with an average marker distance of 1.98 cM. There are four high marker-density blocks distributed on three LGs and three regions of segregation distortion (SDRs) identified on two other LGs, two of which co-locate in chromosomal regions syntenic to SDRs in soybean.

Central to the inflammatory process in asthma is the recruitment of eosinophils to the airways, which release proteases and proinflammatory factors and contribute to airway remodeling. The aim of this study was to establish a new approach to non-invasively assess lung eosinophilia during the course of experimental asthma by combining non-invasive near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with the specific detection of Siglec-F, a lectin found predominantly on eosinophils. Methodology/Principal Findings: An ovalbumin (OVA)-based model was used to induce asthma-like experimental allergic airway disease (EAAD) in BALB/c mice. By means of a NIRF imager, we demonstrate that 48 h–72 h after intravenous (i.v.) application of a NIRF-labeled anti-Siglec-F antibody, mice with EAAD exhibited up to 2 times higher fluorescence intensities compared to lungs of control mice. Furthermore, average lung intensities of dexamethasone-treated as well as beta-escin-treated mice were 1.8 and 2 times lower than those of untreated, EAAD mice, respectively and correlated with the reduction of cell infiltration in the lung. Average fluorescence intensities measured in explanted lungs confirmed the in vivo findings of significantly higher values in inflamed lungs as compared to controls. Fluorescence microscopy of lung cryosections localized the i.v. applied NIRF-labeled anti-Siglec-F antibody predominantly to eosinophils in the peribronchial areas of EAAD lungs as opposed to control lungs. Conclusion/Significance: We show that monitoring the occurrence of eosinophils, a prominent feature of allergic asthma, by means of a NIRF-labeled antibody directed against Siglec-F is a novel and powerful non-invasive optical imaging approach to assess EAAD and therapeutic response in mice over time.

Optical imaging was performed by FRI using the Optix MX2 System (ART, Montreal, Canada), which comprises an interface for inhalation anesthetics and four pulsed lasers (635, 670, 730 and 785 nm). During in vivo scans, mice were anaesthetized by inhalation with 2% isoflurane, 2l/min oxygen for 15–20 min per scan. For detailed description of the working principle of the Optix MX2 please refer to Dullin et al.

Alexa Fluor 680 fluorescence was measured using an excitation of 670 nm in combination with a 700 nm long-pass emission filter. Scans were performed with a 1.5 mm (whole body scans) or 1.0 mm (lung scans) raster, a photon collection time (integration time) of 0.3–1 s per scan point and varying laser power. Intensity data and lifetime were analyzed with the OptiView-2-02-00 software (ART).\nFluorescence intensity data are displayed in normalized counts (NC), where the measured fluorescence intensity (counts) was normalized for varying laser power and integration times, allowing comparison of measurements with different settings.

The pestivirus N-terminal protease (Npro) is a cysteine autoprotease that cleaves between its own C-terminus and the N-terminus of the core protein. Due to its unique sequence and catalytic site, it forms its own cysteine protease family C53. After self-cleavage, Npro is no longer active as a protease. The released Npro suppresses the induction of the host's type-I interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β) response. Npro binds interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), the key transcriptional activator of IFN-α/β genes, and promotes degradation of IRF3 by the proteasome, thus preventing induction of the IFN-α/β response to pestivirus infection. Here we report the crystal structures of pestivirus Npro. Npro is structurally distinct from other known cysteine proteases and has a novel “clam shell” fold consisting of a protease domain and a zinc-binding domain. The unique fold of Npro allows auto-catalysis at its C-terminus and subsequently conceals the cleavage site in the active site of the protease. Although many viruses interfere with type I IFN induction by targeting the IRF3 pathway, little information is available regarding structure or mechanism of action of viral proteins that interact with IRF3. The distribution of amino acids on the surface of Npro involved in targeting IRF3 for proteasomal degradation provides insight into the nature of Npro's interaction with IRF3. The structures thus establish the mechanism of auto-catalysis and subsequent auto-inhibition of trans-activity of Npro, and its role in subversion of host immune response.\nAuthor Summary: Mammalian cells respond to viral infection by inducing an innate immune response involving interferon-α/β that mediates cellular antiviral defenses. Viruses, in turn, have evolved mechanisms to counter the host's innate immune response by inhibiting the interferon response. Pestiviruses use the virally encoded N-terminal protease (Npro) to suppress interferon-α/β induction. Npro first cleaves itself off from the viral polyprotein using its own cysteine protease activity. Released Npro then interacts with interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), a transcriptional activator of interferon-β, and induces proteasome-mediated degradation of IRF3. We have determined the crystal structure of Npro from classical swine fever virus. Npro has a unique protease fold consisting of two domains. The N-terminal domain carries the protease active site and has the C-terminus, the auto-cleavage site, bound in the active site. Thus, following auto-cleavage at the C-terminus, Npro obstructs the catalytic site preventing further activity, making the protease active only once in its lifetime. The C-terminal domain carries a zinc-binding site that is required for interaction with IRF3. Surface mapping of the Npro residues essential for subversion of interferon induction provides insight into the interaction with IRF3 and its subsequent degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first structure of a direct IRF3 antagonist.

The DNA fragment containing the Npro gene was then subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of pET-15b vector to obtain pET-6H-throm-Npro(Alf) [28]. The N-terminal deletion mutants were designed based on limited proteolysis results [28]. The Npro construct lacking the first 17 amino acids (Npro-Δ17N) was amplified from the full-length construct using the oligonucleotide primers 5′ ggcagccatatgggagtggaggaaccggtatac 3′ (forward) and 5′ cggatcctcgagttagcaactggtaacccacaatgg 3′ (reverse). The PCR product was again sub-cloned into the pET15b expression vector between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The C168A mutant with the additional four residues of the core protein (NproΔ17N-C168A-SDDG) was cloned similarly using the reverse primer 5′ gtggtgctcgagttagccatcatcagaggcactggtaac 3′. All constructs were verified using DNA sequencing. The resulting proteins have a hexa-histidine tag (His-tag) and the thrombin cleavage sequence (LVPRGS) on the N-terminus of the protein.\n\nExpression and purification of Npro proteins\nThe Npro mutants were expressed and purified as described in ref. 28. His-tagged Npro proteins, purified using Talon metal affinity chromatography resin (Clontech) were pooled and dialyzed in buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) overnight, and the N-terminal His-tag cleaved using thrombin protease immobilized on agarose beads (ThermoScientific). The cleavage reaction was performed with 1% thrombin (w/w) at room temperature in buffer A for 4 hrs. Cleaved Npro-Δ17N was separated by passing the mixture through the Talon resin equilibrated in buffer A. Npro-Δ17N-C168A was purified similarly except that 10% glycerol was added during thrombin cleavage of the His-tag. Glycerol was necessary to stabilize the protein during the cleavage reaction at room temperature. The protein was >95% pure judged by SDS-PAGE. Both proteins were monomers in solution as judged by size-exclusion chromatography.\n\nCrystallization of Npro-Δ17N proteins\nProteins were concentrated to ∼4.5 mg/ml. Initial crystallization trials were conducted using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 96-well plates using a Phoenix RE liquid handling robot (Rigaku). 200 nL protein solution was mixed with equal volumes of a range of precipitants obtained from commercially available crystal screens. Crystals appeared in several conditions within a week. Diffraction quality crystals of Npro-Δ17N grew in 25% PEG3350, 0.2 M MgCl2 (or 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4) and 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.4. Npro-Δ17N-C168A crystallized in 25% PEG3350 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4 (or 0.2 M Li2SO4) and 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5.\n\nData collection, structure determination and refinement\nThe Npro-Δ17N crystals were cryo-cooled at 100 K using paratone as cryo-protectant. High redundancy data was collected using Bruker's Microstar microfocus X-ray Source equipped with a Platinum135 CCD detector. The data were indexed and merged using the Bruker AXS PROTEUM2 software suite for X-ray crystallography (Bruker AXS (2010). PROTEUM2, Version 2010.5, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The crystals diffracted to 1.6 Å resolution and belonged to the space group P21212 with a = 60.1, b = 62.6, c = 30.8 Å. The solvent content was 35% with a monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of Npro-Δ17N was solved via the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (SAD) using the anomalous signal present in sulfur atoms illuminated by a copper K-α home X-ray source. Determination of the positions of sulfur atoms, phasing, and calculation of electron density maps were performed using AutoSol wizard in the Phenix package [42], [43]. The initial atomic model was obtained using the Autobuild wizard in Phenix [44]. The final model was achieved using manual model building with the program O [45] followed by iterative cycles of refinement with phenix.refine. All residues from Glu21 to Cys168 were visible in the electron density map except residues 65–71, which encompasses the catalytic Cys69.\nDiffraction data for Npro-Δ17N-C168A crystals was collected to 1.6 Å using a Rigaku FRE++ X-ray source and an RAXIS-IV™ detector at UTMB. Data was indexed in the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 41.5, b = 58.3, and c = 75.5 Å, different from the Npro-Δ17N protein. The solvent content of the crystals was 54%. The structure of Npro-Δ17N-C168A was determined using molecular replacement with the Npro-Δ17N structure as a model. An atomic model was built using Auto-Build, and phenix.refine was used for refinement of the final model. All residues from Met18 to Cys168 were visible except amino acids 145–149. New crystal packing interactions involving the active site contributed to the stabilization of the helix carrying the nucleophilic Cys69. Strong density (visible at >8σ) at the center of the coordination complex at the active site indicated the presence of a metal ion at the site. SAD data at the zinc absorption edge were collected at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) synchrotron macromolecular crystallography beamline at Louisiana State University. An anomalous difference Fourier map was calculated to confirm the presence of zinc. Ramachandran plots for both structures were generated using the program PROCHECK [46] in CCP4. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1.\n\nProtein structure accession codes\nThe coordinates and associated structure factors for this publication have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank and assigned the following accession codes: 4H9J and 4H9K for the Npro-Δ17N and Npro-Δ17N-C168A, respectively.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/title","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/abstract","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/references","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/body","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/introduction","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003704/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/conclusions","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nCorrect cell fate choice is crucial in development. In post-embryonic development of the hermaphroditic Caenorhabitis elegans, distinct cell fates must be adopted in two diverse tissues. In the germline, stem cells adopt one of three possible fates: mitotic cell cycle, or gamete formation via meiosis, producing either sperm or oocytes. In the epidermis, the stem cell-like seam cells divide asymmetrically, with the daughters taking on either a proliferative (seam) or differentiated (hypodermal or neuronal) fate. We have isolated a novel conserved C. elegans tetratricopeptide repeat containing protein, TRD-1, which is essential for cell fate determination in both the germline and the developing epidermis and has homologs in other species, including humans (TTC27). We show that trd-1(RNAi) and mutant animals have fewer seam cells as a result of inappropriate differentiation towards the hypodermal fate. In the germline, trd-1 RNAi results in a strong masculinization phenotype, as well as defects in the mitosis to meiosis switch. Our data suggests that trd-1 acts downstream of tra-2 but upstream of fem-3 in the germline sex determination pathway, and exhibits a constellation of phenotypes in common with other Mog (masculinization of germline) mutants. Thus, trd-1 is a new player in both the somatic and germline cell fate determination machinery, suggestive of a novel molecular connection between the development of these two diverse tissues.\n"],"title":"The C. elegans TPR Containing Protein, TRD-1, Regulates Cell Fate Choice in the Developing Germ Line and Epidermis","materials_and_methods":["\nStrains and maintenance of worms\nStrains were derived from the wild type N2 Bristol strain and maintained at 20°C unless otherwise stated [23]. Strains used are detailed in Table 1. We obtained a single trd-1 deletion allele (tm2764) from the National BioResource Project in Japan. The tm2764 allele is an 893 bp deletion, removing part of exons 4 and 5. To maintain, and simultaneously outcross, the trd-1(tm2764) allele, we balanced it with the hT2(I;III) reciprocal translocation generating strain AW626. Self-progeny of AW626 included viable and fertile tm2764/hT2 (essentially wild type animals), hT2 homozygous animals which are embryonic lethal and trd-1(tm2764) homozygous animals that arrest as embryos or larvae, with only a small proportion making it to adulthood. We made a similar strain, AW912, which also contained the integrated scm::gfp reporter to allow visualization of seam cells in homozygous mutants.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114998.t001Table 1\nStrains used in this investigation.\n\n\n\n\nStrain Name\nGenotype\nPlasmid description\n\n\nN2\nWild type\n\n\n\n\n\nAW60\nunc-119(e2498)III; him-5(e1490); wIs51 [pMF1+ pDP#MM016β] V\npMF1[scm::gfp] pDP#MM016β[unc-119(+)]\n\n\nAW626\nT20B12.1/hT2 (I;III)\nhT2[bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48]\n\n\nAW912\nT20B12.1/hT2 (I;III); him-5(e1490); wIs51[pMF1+ pDP#MM016β] V\nhT2[bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48] pMF1[scm::gfp] pDP#MM016β[unc-119(+)]\n\n\nAW1015\nunc-119(ed3)III ouIs10 [pAW584+pAW516+pAW561+unc-119(+)]\npAW584[scm::dTtomato] pAW516[dpy-7p::2xNLS::yfp] pAW561[Pwrt-2::gfp-PH]\n\n\nCB3778\ntra-2(e2020)II\n\n\n\nCB4034\nfem-3(e2006ts) him-8(e1489)IV\n\n\n\nCB5098\nfem-3(q20ts)IV\n\n\n\nJK560\nfog-1(q253ts)I\n\n\n\nJK2868\nunc-119(ed3)III; qIs56 V\nqIs56[lag-2p::GFP + unc-119(+)]\n\n\nJK3101\nfbf-2(q738)II\n\n\n\nJK3354\ngld-3(q741)/mIn1[mIs14 dpy-10(e218)] II\nmIs14[myo-2::gfp; pes-10::gfp]\n\n\nJR667\nunc-119(e2498)III; wIs51[pMF1+ pDP#MM016β] V\npMF1[scm::gfp] pDP#MM016β[unc-119(+)]\n\n\nNK624\nunc-119(ed4)III; qyIs100[T20B12.1::gfp + pDP#MM016β]\npDP#MM016β[unc-119(+)]\n\n\nT20B12.1\nT20B12.1(tm2764/+)III\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroscopy\nDIC (Nomarski) and fluorescent imaging was carried out using a Zeiss AxioSKOP2 microscope with a Zeiss AxioCamMR digital camera. Photomicrographs were taken using a x63 oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and Axiovision software (Release 4.5). Confocal images were taken on a Leica TCS SP5II using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Lite software (Release 2.2.1). In both cases, animals were mounted on agarose pads (2% agarose, 0.5% 1-phenoxy-2-propanol in M9) in 0.2% 1-phenoxy-2-propanol.\n\nLineage analysis\nLineage analysis was performed as previously described [1]. Seam nuclei were identified based on their morphology, and confirmed where necessary by monitoring expression of the seam specific GFP reporter, scm::gfp. Microscopy was performed with Normarski (DIC) optics and an x100 oil immersion objective (Zeiss) using a Zeiss AxioPlan microscope. A total of 7 animals were followed from hatching through the L1 division to the mid-L2 stage.\n\nRNAi experiments\nRNA interference experiments were performed using the Ahringer RNAi library and protocol at 20°C, unless otherwise stated [24]. For seam cell and gonad morphology analysis, dsRNA was delivered by feeding to L4 stage animals and the phenotypes observed in next generation L4 and adults (L4+1 day). For experiments involving temperature sensitive (ts) mutants, gravid hermaphrodites were age synchronized by bleaching. To achieve synchronization, gravid animals were washed off plates with M9 buffer into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and pelleted at 2500 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and 6 mL of M9 added followed by 6 mL of bleach solution (12.5 mL 4 M NaOH, 20 mL 12% sodium hypochlorite and 17.5 mL water). Tubes were vigorously shaken for 3 minutes before centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 90 seconds. The supernatant was removed and the egg pellet washed 3 times with M9 buffer. Following the last wash, 10 mL M9 was added and the tubes left rotating at 15°C. Eggs were left to hatch and larvae allowed to develop to L1 in M9 overnight (in the absence of food) at 15°C before being placed on trd-1 RNAi feeding plates. The plates were then shifted to 25°C, the restrictive temperature, before analysis at the L4 and adult (L4+1 day) stage. Control animals were subjected to identical manipulations.\n\nWhole worm DAPI\nWorms were washed off RNAi plates with M9 buffer and centrifuged for 90 seconds at 2500 rpm in 15 mL centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with M9 buffer a further 3 times. The worm pellet was then incubated in 150 nM DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in 100% ethanol (200 µL) in a watch glass. After 20 minutes, when the liquid had almost completely evaporated, the nematodes were rehydrated in 1 mL of M9 buffer for 40 minutes, transferred into a micro-centrifuge tube and spun for 60 seconds at 2500 rpm. Worms from the pellet were resuspended in a small volume (5–10 µL) of the remaining supernatant and 3.5 µL of the suspension mounted onto an agarose pad (2% agarose in water) with 2 µL anti-fade (AF3 in PBS, CitiFluor) and sealed with varnish.\n\nDetermination of the mitotic zone\nThe mitotic zone was determined as previously described [6], [8]. Briefly, the number of germ cell diameters along the distal-proximal axis from the distal tip to the transition zone was counted. The transition zone is defined as being the point at which cells have the crescent shaped nuclei, characteristic of meiotic prophase I, as determined by DAPI staining.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein lysates were prepared by boiling 10 adult worms at 95°C for 10 minutes in 20 µL of Laemli Buffer (1.25 mL 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2.5 mL Glycerol, 2 mL 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 mL β-mercaptoethanol and Bromophenol Blue, made up to 10 mL with ddH2O). The sample was then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube. Benzonaze enzyme (0.3 µL) was added and lysates run on a 10% NuPage gel (Novex). The proteins were probed with either a mouse α-MSP (major sperm protein, 4A5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) at 1∶1000 dilution or a rabbit α-actin (polyclonal goat α-rabbit HRP, Dako) at 1∶1000. The signal was detected with GE Healthcare ECL reagent and blots were visualized on an autoradiography film.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114998/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Objective: Lack of social support is a strong predictor for poor mental health after disasters. Psychosocial post-disaster interventions may benefit from targeting survivors at risk of low support, yet it is unknown whether demographic and disaster exposure characteristics are associated with social support. This study assessed if age, gender, educational status, cohabitation, and disaster exposure severity predicted aspects of informal social support in a cohort of Swedish survivors from the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami. Methods: The participants were 3,536 disaster survivors who responded to a mail survey 14 months after the disaster (49% response rate). Their perceptions of present emotional support, contact with others, tangible support, negative support and overall satisfaction with informal support were assessed with the Crisis Support Scale and analysed in five separate ordinal regressions. Results: Demographic factors and exposure severity explained variation in social supports although the effect size and predictive efficiency were modest. Cohabitation and female gender were associated with both more positive and more negative support. Single-household men were at risk for low emotional support and younger women were more likely to perceive negative support. Higher education was associated with more positive support, whereas no clear pattern was found regarding age as a predictor. Disaster exposure severity was associated with more negative support and less overall support satisfaction. Conclusions: After a disaster that entailed little disruptions to the community the associations between demographic characteristics and social support concur with findings in the general population. The findings suggest that psychosocial disaster interventions may benefit from targeting specific groups of survivors.

All participants provided written informed consent. Participants between 16 and 18 years of age needed written consent from their caregivers. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nProcedure\nThis study was part of a follow-up of Swedish tourists afflicted by the Indian Ocean tsunami on December 26, 2004, and previous findings from the data herein have assessed the impact on mental health with regard to exposure severity [1] and social support [10]. The Swedish authorities registered 13,638 adult residents repatriated from Southeast Asia between December 27, 2004 and January 15, 2005. The 21 counties in Sweden were approached to allow for the survey to be sent to residents in their respective county. Residents in the 10 counties that agreed to participate were identified and the questionnaire was distributed in March 2006. The survey was based on a Norwegian follow-up of tsunami survivors [32] and adapted to Swedish in collaboration with the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics and with the Center for Family and Community Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. Only variables of relevance to the current study are reported.\n\nParticipants\nThe questionnaire was sent to 10,501 individuals ≥16 years of age (77% of those registered by the authorities upon repatriation). Of 4,932 returned questionnaires there were 4,910 that could be retained for analysis. There were 385 individuals who rejected participation per e-mail or telephone, of whom 59% stated not being in an afflicted region as their reason, and 1% stated that they could not cope with filling out the questionnaire. Nonresponse was weakly associated with younger age and living in a large city (data not shown).\nIn order to select a sample that most likely had experienced a potentially traumatic stressor, respondents were included in this study if they had been exposed to any of a number of exposure criteria: The direct exposure group were those who experienced threat to life, and/or were caught by the waves, and/or were severely injured in the disaster; indirect exposure were those who had not experienced the above, but experienced death of, or life threat to close ones; and vicarious exposure were those who had not been exposed to any of the above but witnessed horrifying events (i.e., deceased people, survivors with severe injuries, people searching for others among corpses).\n\nMeasures\nThe Crisis Support Scale (CSS) [33] was used to assess levels of current support in relation to the event from friends and relatives. The CSS is composed of seven items with a seven-point scale ranging from never (1) to always (7), with the items being 1. availability of others; 2. contact with others with similar experiences; 3. confiding in others; 4. emotional support; 5. tangible support; 6. negative response; and 7. overall satisfaction with support. Item 7 has previously been analysed separately from the summated score of the other items, with item negative response reversed [33]. Also, a composite score for item 1–4 has been used, with negative response analysed separately [23]. A factor analysis found that the CSS contained two factors where items 1, 3, and 4 loaded on one factor, negative response was a single item on the second factor, and contact with others loaded on both factors [21]. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha for items 1–6 was.73. Items contact with others and negative response had low item-total correlations, r = .35 and.11, respectively. Omitting these two items increased the internal consistency for the four remaining items to Cronbach’s alpha = .83. Thus, the mean score of items 1, 3, and 4 was analysed as a composite measure of perceived emotional support, and the remaining items were analysed as contact with others, negative support, and overall satisfaction with support.\nCohabitation was coded as either living with spouse/partner or being single/widow/widower. Educational status was coded as university degree or not. Age was grouped into adolescents (16–19 years), young adults (20–29 years), middle-aged (30–49 years; reference group), aged (50–65 years), and retired (≥65 years).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nOrdinal regressions [34] were used to estimate the associations between demographic and exposure characteristics and social support with a separate regression for each aspect of social support. The ordinal odds ratio summarises the average change in odds for moving across any binary social support threshold, and is valid over all thresholds. The assumption that odds ratios are homogenous across thresholds was satisfied by collapsing the two lowest scoring options (after reversal of negative support) into one category. In addition, an assessment of binary logistic regression odds ratios for each threshold of each dependent variable revealed small differences in direction and on average, which indicated homogenous odds ratios across thresholds. To assess joint effects of predictor variables, first-order interaction terms were added to the regression equations and subsequently removed if p>.05.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed by duplicating the regression analyses without interaction terms on a new dataset including the original data and imputed cases. The predictors and outcomes for the set of imputed cases were given frequency distributions that reflected the distributions in the respondents. The bivariate associations between predictors and outcomes were set to be unrelated (ρ = 0). The odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported, together with Likelihood ratio R2 (RL2) and predictive efficiency (τp). The τp indicates the reduction in discrete classification error [35]. Analyses were performed with PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065709/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0114997","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Household water treatment (HWT) can improve drinking water quality and prevent disease if used correctly and consistently by vulnerable populations. Over 1.1 billion people report treating their water prior to drinking it. These estimates, however, are based on responses to household surveys that may exaggerate the consistency and microbiological performance of the practice—key factors for reducing pathogen exposure and achieving health benefits. The objective of this study was to examine how HWT practices are actually performed by households identified as HWT users, according to international monitoring standards. Methods and Findings: We conducted a 6-month case study in urban (n = 117 households) and rural (n = 115 households) Peru, a country in which 82.8% of households report treating their water at home. We used direct observation, in-depth interviews, surveys, spot-checks, and water sampling to assess water treatment practices among households that claimed to treat their drinking water at home. While consistency of reported practices was high in both urban (94.8%) and rural (85.3%) settings, availability of treated water (based on self-report) at time of collection was low, with 67.1% and 23.0% of urban and rural households having treated water at all three sampling visits. Self-reported consumption of untreated water in the home among adults and children <5 was common and this was corroborated during home observations. Drinking water of self-reported users was significantly better than source water in the urban setting and negligible but significantly better in the rural setting. However, only 46.3% and 31.6% of households had drinking water <1 CFU/100 mL at all follow-up visits. Conclusions: Our results raise questions about the usefulness of current international monitoring of HWT practices and their usefulness as a proxy indicator for drinking water quality. The lack of consistency and sub-optimal microbiological effectiveness also raises questions about the potential of HWT to prevent waterborne diseases.

Our baseline survey followed closely the surveys used by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which the JMP heavily relies on for monitoring access to water and sanitation [6]. Data collection tools were translated into Spanish and piloted before use. A random selection of 115 households from those households identified as HWT practitioners during the baseline survey (i.e. responded affirmatively to the JMP core question on HWT —“Do you treat your water in any way to make it safer to drink?”) were followed-up. As detailed further below and in Fig. 1, follow-up consisted of (A) either (i) a second household HWT practice survey, or (ii) structured observations in the home together with in-depth interviews (IDI), plus (B) spot-check observations and water sampling. The study was independently conducted in both urban and rural settings.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114997.g001Figure 1\nSchematic representation of the study design.\n\nStudy setting, participant eligibility\nThe study was conducted from November 2011 through March 2012 in the northern highlands of Peru, in the Province of San Marcos, Cajamarca. The urban setting was in San Marcos, the capital city of the province; the rural setting was in three neighbouring villages, Illuca, La Laguna and La Manzanilla, 70 km north of San Marcos city. The urban community consists mainly of retail, services and the commercial sector with most people living in cement buildings, while the rural communities comprise mostly of subsistence farmers living in houses made out of earthen floors and adobe walls. In the rural setting, all households in the three villages were approached for participation. In the urban setting, due to the unavailability of a sampling frame, the city was subdivided into seven sectors of approximately similar size and systematic sampling was used to select the participating households. In both settings, study participants were recruited through door-to-door visits. Households were eligible to participate if (i) at least one household member lived permanently in the household, (ii) in those cases where only one member resided in the household, that the household member had no impediments to providing informed consent, and (iii) the household was not planning on moving in the next three months.\n\nSample size\nThe sample size calculation was based on precision estimates rather than power estimates as we were not interested in comparing groups but rather in determining, with a given precision, certain characteristics of reported HWT-users. Aiming for a precision of ±10% and an anticipated proportion of interest of 0.7, a minimum of 80 households reporting HWT-use was required. This was increased to 115 households to account for potential loss to follow-up. Using the ENDES 2004–6 [31] figures on HWT-use in urban and rural settings for the province of Cajamarca (75.7% and 53.7%, respectively) it was estimated that 152 and 217 households would need to be recruited in urban and rural settings, respectively to identify the required number of households claiming to perform HWT.\n\nHome observations and in-depth interview\nStructured observations were undertaken to assess whether, and how often, HWT was performed and to determine whether treated water was consumed exclusively in the household or whether it was supplemented with untreated water from other sources. Approximately 15% of the participating households were purposely selected to complete three days of direct observations in their home followed by an in-depth interview administered at the end of the observation period. Only households with at least one child <5 years of age were invited to participate in the home observations. Observation times were pre-arranged with the female head of the household and were scheduled to last between 4–6 h. Observations were presented to have broader public health aims to minimize drawing attention to water handling or HWT practices. Female enumerators undertook all observations.\n\nReported HWT practices survey\nThe remaining 85% of the participating households completed a second survey (hereinafter, the “HWT practices survey”). In this survey, participants were questioned a second time about their HWT practices, allowing the assessment of the concordance of the HWT-use responses with those obtained during baseline. The second aim of the survey was to obtain further insight into HWT practices, with special focus on adherence to the practice: (i) frequency of use, (ii) consumption of treated water in the home, and (iii) exclusive drinking of treated water (non-supplementation) by the survey respondent and children under 5 years of age living in the household.\n\nObservational spot-check visits\nAll participating households were visited on two further occasions, at intervals of four to twelve days to complete an observational spot-check visit. The main aims of these spot-check visits were to determine whether the water available for drinking was reported to have been treated and if so, whether the necessary materials to perform HWT were available (an objective proxy measure of HWT-use). Data were also gathered on other potential objective proxy measures of HWT-use, such as water in the storage container of water filters for those reporting filtration, free chlorine residuals (FCR) in the water for those reporting chlorination, and temperature of water for those reporting boiling. These visits were unannounced. To reduce the potential of reactivity in future visits, spot-check observations of the sanitation and hand-washing facilities were undertaken at the start of each visit.\n\nWater quality\nTo characterise the microbiological quality of the drinking-water of those households identified at baseline to report following a HWT method deemed “adequate” by the JMP (i.e. reported boiling, filtration, chlorination or solar disinfection [6]), we collected one sample of drinking-water at unannounced visits from each participating household during the HWT practices survey (or IDI) and at the two observational spot-check visits. Fieldworkers were instructed to ask the participant: “If you or someone in this household wanted a drink of water right now, what water would you drink from?” In the case that there were children <5 years in the household, fieldworkers were instructed to ask in reference to the children <5 years. Efforts were made to identify all possible containers of stored drinking-water. A 125 mL sample was collected aseptically from the most frequently used container. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the reported HWT method, immediately thereafter, a paired “source water” sample was collected from the source (standpipe, well, etc.) from which the household reported drawing the drinking-water. All water samples were collected in sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) containing a tablet of sodium thiosulphate to neutralise any halogen disinfectant. Samples were placed on ice and processed within 4 h of collection to assess levels of thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), an indicator of faecal contamination [32]. Microbiological assessment was performed using the membrane filtration technique [33] on membrane lauryl sulphate medium (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) using a DelAgua field incubator (Robens Institute, University of Surrey, Guilford, Surrey, UK).\n\nData analysis\nAll data were double entered into Microsoft Excel 2008 and analysed using STATA version 10 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Due to over-dispersion of the water quality data and excess 0 values, the arithmetic as well as the Williams means are presented. The Williams mean is calculated by adding 1 to all the data values, then taking the geometric mean, then subtracting 1 again [34]. To assess whether the drinking-water of reported adequate HWT-users identified at baseline was of higher quality than the source water, the log differences of the paired source-drinking water samples was calculated for each of the three individual rounds of follow-up. Overall, source and drinking-water TTC counts were compared using random effects negative binomial regression to account for (i) repeated observations within households, and (ii) the positive skewed distribution of the TTC counts. For the purpose of analysis, plates that yielded coliform forming units (CFUs) that were too numerous to count (TNTC) were assigned a value of 500 CFU. For the home observations, simple descriptive analysis, involving counting of relevant events (such a water drinking events or use of HWT) and descriptions of HWT events was undertaken. We measured a household's consistency of reporting HWT as the number of times a households reported to perform HWT (at baseline and during the HWT practices survey or IDI) and the number of times they reported to have treated water at the three water collection visits (HWT practices survey or IDI and observational spot-check visits). We further assessed consistency of use by crosschecking reported daily use or non-supplementation and the availability of treated water (based on self-report) at the time of the interview.\n\nEthics\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the London School and Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Reference No. 5696 dated 13 April 2010) and by the internal Research Ethics Committee of the Instituto de Investigación Nutricional (Reference No. 319-2011/CEI-IIN dated 8 August 2011). Informed written consent to participate in the research was obtained from the head of the household or spouse of each participating household.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000455/body","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000455/introduction","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000455/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000455/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065712/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065712/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065712/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065712/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065712/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nCryostat sectioning is a popular but labor-intensive method for preparing histological brain sections. We have developed a modification of the commercially available CryoJane tape collection method that significantly improves the ease of collection and the final quality of the tissue sections.

The method is also suitable for larger brains, such as rat and monkey.\n"],"title":"High-Throughput Method of Whole-Brain Sectioning, Using the Tape-Transfer Technique","materials_and_methods":["Three basic steps were required for cutting and mounting frozen mouse brain sections without introducing distortions or section damage. In brief, these are: (1) Section collection onto tape. For each section to be collected, an individual segment of tape (“tape-window”) is manually attached to the face of the tissue block, using a hard-roller. The tape remains attached to the section, as it is cut from the block, and helps to maintain the shape and integrity of the section. (2) Section transfer to slide. The tape and adhered section are transferred to a curing platform and placed onto a slide that is pre-coated with a UV-activated polymer. Air bubbles are removed using a soft-roller. This process is repeated for up to 3 tape windows per slide. (3) UV curing of the sections. The lever door of the platform is then closed, and a brief pulse of UV light is applied. This results in curing of the UV polymer and a firm adhesion of the sections to the slide. All tape-windows are then peeled away and the slides are removed from the cryostat.\n2.1 System Components\nIn addition to the mouse brains, system components are: 1 curing platform with 2 UV-LED arrays; 1 hard-roller; 1 soft-roller; multiple tape-windows, glass slides, and a cryostat. The number of tape-windows and glass slides depends on the size of the sample to be cut. One tape-window is needed for each section that is collected. Up to 3 tape-windows can be placed on a single 1X3 slide. A comparison of this system and the commercially available CyoJane is shown in Table 1. All components were customized for this application, as detailed below.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102363.t001\nTable 1 Customized Parameters of Tape-Transfer Curing Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial CryoJane\nModified System\n\n\n\n\nDuration of UV pulse\n8 milliseconds\n~5–6 seconds (can be increased as needed)\n\n\nNumber of pulses required\n>2 (slide is rotated between pulses)\n1\n\n\nInterval between repeated pulses\n>30 seconds (or fuse will blow)\n0.00\n\n\nTotal Irradiance per pulse (uW-sec)\n40\n1600–2000\n\n\nSlide Capacity\n1\n2\n\n\nFuse Replacement\n2-5x per week (continuous use)\nNo Fuses\n\n\nSectioning Rate (Slides/Hour)\n20\n50\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the UV-LEDs as a means of adhering sections to the slide is superior to the commercial CryoJane system because the UV can be applied over a longer time (seconds versus milliseconds). This extended application time allows in a 40–50X increase in the total amount of UV that is applied to the slide. We have arranged the UV-LEDs into an array that delivers equal amount of UV across the entire slide. Therefore a single pulse of UV can be used to adhere all of the sections on the slide, without the need to rotate the slide. As a result of these improvements, sectioning rate has increased by 2.5X. Section quality is system independent (when 2 pulses per slide are used with the CryoJane system) and a direct function of sectioning procedure (Fig 3).\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Animals\nAll animal studies, experiments, and procedures were discussed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and conform to all federal regulations and the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals were acquired from Jackson Laboratories (stock 000664). The animals were 56±3 day old mice, C5BL/6, with a weight of 18.8–26.4 grams. Avertine (2.5%) was used as the anesthetic. The animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; JT Baker, JTS898-7), after a saline preflush of 50mL that was used to remove the blood. The brains were extracted and post-fixed in a solution of 4% PFA with 10% sucrose (JT Baker, 4072–05) in PBS, for 24 hours. The brains were further cryo-protected in 20% sucrose in PBS for an additional 24 hours.\n\n\n2.1.2 Curing Platform\nA custom platform supports the glass slides in the cryostat and is used in the curing process. The slides are placed side-by-side, each into a slot in the top surface of the platform. Each slot is centered above an array of 65 UV-LEDs (Nichia Corp, NSPU510CS) soldered onto a four-layer printed-circuit board (PCB) (Sunstone Corporation). The platform contains a lever door, which is used to isolate the irradiated area and to protect the operator. An exploded view of the platform is shown in Fig 2. The Base Enclosure, the Lever Door and the Top-Cover were 3-D printed (PolyJet Technology) in VeroWhite, through Vistatek Corporation (Vadnais Heights, MN) and assembled with other off-the-shelf components. The model files and engineering drawings can be provided upon request.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102363.g002\nFig 2\n\nAn exploded-view of the redesigned tape-transfer system curing platform.\nThe platform is composed of: the base enclosure, the printed circuit board (PCB) with soldered UV-LEDs, a glass plate, a top cover, foam spacers, a foam pad, and a lever door. With the exception of the PCB, the glass plate, the foam spacers and pad, all other components were 3-D printed in VeroWhite, through Vistatek Corporation (Vadnais Heights, MN). The base enclosure has side access, to allow for connecting the ground and power terminals of the UV-LEDs. The enclosure as illustrated at bottom left allows for sections to be collected on two slides and for the slides to be cured simultaneously. A front view of the platform is shown on the top left. When lowered, the lever door and foam pad are intended to shield the operator from the UV activation and to apply a mild pressure on the slides, which facilitates the curing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 UV-LED array\nThe UV-LEDs are arranged in 5 rows of 13 LEDS, in a parallel resistor network, such that even UV intensity can be applied across the surface of the slides. The common terminals of the two arrays are connected to a single DC power source (Omron Corporation, S8VS-03005) and regulated by an on-off latching switch.\n\n\n2.1.4 Hand Rollers\nThe system requires the use of two different rollers. The hard-roller is composed of a hollow PVC pipe that is suspended on a plastic handle (Leica Corp, 39475218), and helps in applying adequate pressure onto the tape. This ensures a firm adhesion to the blockface of the sample. The soft-roller is made by threading a silicone tube over the PVC pipe of the hard-roller. This helps to remove air bubbles trapped between the glass slide and the tape-window, without damaging the tissue sections. The soft-roller helps to spread the applied pressure and prevent cracking of the sections.\n\n\n2.1.5 Tape-Windows and Slide Preparation\nStandard adhesive tape-windows (Leica Corp, 39475214) were used for all samples. Either pre-coated slides (Leica Corp, 39475208) or those prepared in-house were used. The in-house slide coating procedure used Solution A (Leica Corp, 39475270) to clean the slides and Solution B (Leica Corp, 39475272) to coat the slides. Solution B is the UV-activated polymer that adheres the cut sections onto the glass slides. This was derived from the CryoJane operating protocol [1], with consultation from Instrumedics Corporation. In terms of section quality, we have not found a significant difference between the two slide types. We prefer to coat the slides in-house due to bulk cost savings.\n\n\n2.1.6 Cryostat and Environmental Setup\nA standard Microm HM550, with a disposable knife carrier and MX-35 low-profile knife (Thermo Scientific, 3052835) was used to section all samples. The specimen temperature of the cryostat was set to -14±2°C; the temperature of the chamber was set to -16±2°C. The temperature was adjusted based on section quality (See Pitfalls Section 2.5). The environmental conditions surrounding the cryostat were actively regulated, such that the temperature was 17–19°C and the humidity was 45–60%. To ensure optimal circulation of cooled air in the chamber, the cryostat was defrosted weekly.\n\n\n2.2 Brain Freezing and Tape-Transfer Sectioning Workflow\nA 12-part illustration of the tape-transfer method is summarized in Fig 3. The method is described for the sectioning of a brain block of either one or two embedded mouse brains [2]. Dual-brain blocks were used for sectioning coronal samples; single-blocks were used for sagittal and horizontal sectioning. Single-brain blocks were also used for sectioning rat and macaque brains.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102363.g003\nFig 3\n\nProduction use of the tape-transfer system to section perfused mouse brains.\nThis figure shows the use of this system to collect coronal sections of a perfused mouse brain. Step1, remove a frozen brain block from -80°C storage. Allow the block to acclimate in the cryostat for 30 minutes and then freeze the block onto the specimen chuck. The surface to be sectioned, should be facing up (towards the operator). Step2, attach the chuck and block to the specimen holder and orient relative to the knife. Step 3 and 4, trim the block at 50 or 100μm until the first indication of tissue. Step 5, peel the protective film (white arrow) from one chilled tape-window. Step 6, lightly attach the exposed adhesive surface of the tape-window to the blockface. The black line in the lower part of the tape-window should align with the bottom edge of the block. Use the hard-roller to further press and adhere the tape onto the block. Step 7, while supporting the bottom part of the tape-window, cut a 20μm section from the block. Step 8 and 9, move the tape-window and attached section, to the back of the cryostat and then onto a coated glass slide on the curing platform. Use the soft-roller to smooth the tape. Step 10, repeat Steps 5–9 until a total of 3 tape-windows are attached to each slide. Step 11, close the lever-door and apply the UV for 8–10 seconds. Reflections of the UV can be seen in the metal surface of the cryostat and through the open vents. Step 12, peel the tape-windows from each slide at a slight angle and remove the slides from the cryostat.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Brain Freezing\nPost cryo-protection, the brains were embedded in Neg-50 (Richard Allen Scientific, 6502) and frozen using dry-ice chilled isopentane at a temperature of approximately -60°C [2]. For single brain sectioning (1 brain per frozen block), standard cryostat embedding procedure was used [3]. To expedite the sectioning process, we also developed a dual-brain sectioning procedure (2 brains per frozen block), where custom brain-freezing molds were used [2]. Post-freezing, the brain block was trimmed using a razor to a width of ~ 20mm and a height of ~28mm.\n\n\n2.2.2 Brain block preparation (Fig 3, Steps 1–4)\nIn Step 1, a frozen tissue block is removed from -80°C storage, allowed to acclimate for 30 minutes in the cryostat, and then frozen onto the specimen chuck. The block is orientated, typically to allow for coronal sectioning of the embedded brains. The posterior part of the brain specimen is closest to the surface of the chuck. During this time, tape-windows and coated slides should be placed into the cryostat for cooling.\nNext (Step 2), the chuck and block are attached to the specimen holder and oriented relative to the knife. The specimen holder is then advanced toward the knife and the block is trimmed at 50 or 100μm until the first indication of tissue is visible (Steps 3 and 4). The block is now ready for sample collection using the tape method.\n\n\n2.2.3 Section collection onto tape (Fig 3, Steps 5&6)\nOne chilled tape-window is peeled to remove the center protective film (Step 5) and the exposed adhesive surface is lightly attached by hand to the blockface. The black line in the lower part of the tape-window should align with the bottom edge of the block. The hard-roller is then used to further press and adhere the tape onto the block (Step 6).\n\n\n2.2.4 Section transfer to slide (Fig 3, Steps 7–10)\nIn Step 7, while the operator supports the bottom part of the tape (the portion marked “THIS TAB OVER KNIFE”), a 20μm section is cut from the block. The combination of tape + section is then quickly moved into the cold stream of the cryostat (back of the cryostat) and placed onto a coated glass slide on the curing platform (Steps 8 and 9). The soft roller is used to smooth the tape. This process is repeated for 3 tape-windows per slide. Alternating sections are commonly separated into two slide series for different histological procedures (Step 10).\n\n\n2.2.5 UV curing of the sections (Fig 3, Steps 11&12)\nThe lever-door of the curing platform is lowered and a pulse of UV is applied for 8–10 seconds (Step 11). Blue light is seen in the vents of the curing platform. The lever-door is opened and the tape-windows of each slide are peeled at a slight angle (Step 12). The slides are than removed from the cryostat and are ready for staining and coverslipping.\n\n\n2.3 Histology and Imaging\nThe sectioned material was allowed to dry overnight at 4°C. Sections were stained for Nissl bodies, using a thionin based protocol, and coverslipped using DPX. Sections from AAV-injected and transgenic animals (see below) were briefly dehydrated in grades of ethanol (50, 75 and 90%) and coverslipped using DPX. To demonstrate compatibility with a range of common histochemical methods, sections were processed for BDA [4], Wisteria Floribunda Lectin (WFA) [5], Tyrosine Hydroxylase [6] and myelin [7]. In all cases, staining was performed on-the-slide, using either the LabVision 720 (Thermo Scientific) or sealed staining trays (StainTray, M920-2). Subsequent imaging and digitization of the sections were performed using a NanoZoomer HT system, at a resolution of 0.5μm/pixel. For fluorescent imaging, a tri-filter cube (DAPI-FITC-Texas Red filter) (Olympus, L10387) was used.\n\n2.4 Stereotaxic Injections\nTo show that tape-transfer cut sections are compatible with tract tracing, a subset of animals was injected with anterograde or retrograde tracers. Survival surgery was carried out according to NIH guidelines and protocols approved by the CSHL IACUC. Vaporized isoflurane (1.5%) was used as the anesthetic. In some animals, two injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) were performed per animal, the first with AAV-GFP (AAV2/1.CB7.CI.EGFP.WPRE.RBG) and the second with AAV-RPF (AAV2/1.CAG.tdTomato.WPRE.SV40). Both versions were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania vector core. Other animals were injected with 10% biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) (Invitrogen, D1956). In all cases, the Nanoject II (Drummond, 3-000-204) was used to inject a target volume of ~10nL. The AAV-injected animals survived four weeks post-injection, and the BDA-injected animals, for one week. They were then deeply anesthetized and perfused as above (2.1.1).\n\n2.5 Pitfalls\nThe tape-transfer method requires more rigorous controls than conventional sectioning, but when standardized, is very reliable. The major sources of potential error are described below:\n\n2.5.1 Environmental Temperature and Humidity\nMore so than conventional cryostat sectioning, the tape-transfer method requires a stable chamber temperature. We have found that if the outside temperature is above 22°C then the cryostat has difficulty in regulating chamber temperature. For this reason, we maintained the room temperature to 17–19°C. The chamber temperature must remain 3–4°C colder than the specimen temperature. This will ensure that the tape-windows and the slides are also colder than the specimen. If a tape-window warms while adhered to the block or the cut section, the tissue will immediately warm. This warming will cause the section to compress. Since the section is attached to the tape, the adhesive will counteract this force, resulting in wide-spread tearing. Until the sections are UV cured onto the slide, the temperature of the section and any surface that it interacts with, must not rise above the specimen temperature.\nWe have also found that periods of high-humidity can cause excessive ice buildup in the cryostat, which can hamper air flow and cause the chamber to warm. This is most prevalent in the summer months, when we had to place a dedicated dehumidifier (Frigidaire, FAD504TDD) alongside the cryostat. Even at nominal external humidity, we have found that defrosting the cryostat weekly leads to more consistent section quality.\nWe have also found that if the humidity drops below 35%, tissue sections are prone to rapid dehydration (while attached to the tape) and can fracture. This is most prevalent in the winter months, when we placed a dedicated humidifier (Honeywell, HCM-6009) alongside the cryostat.\n\n\n2.5.2 Other Sources of Thermal Damage\nWhen the section is adhered to tape, it is most sensitive to thermal damage. This damage is commonly caused by poor airflow (as discussed above), or interaction with the warm skin of the operator. It is important that the operator never touches the center surface of the tape window; the tape should only be handled by the unpeeled top and bottom tabs (marked: “THIS TAB OVER KNIFE”). It also is important to guard against warm air currents in the front of the chamber. We advise minimizing opening of the chamber lid and quickly moving the cut section, once cut, to the back to the cryostat. Finally, prior to section collection, it is important to chill both the tape-windows and the slides in the cryostat.\n\n\n2.5.3 Section Peeling\nThe UV activation of the polymer-coated slides is temperature sensitive. The slides should be chilled in the cryostat for no more than 30 minutes, otherwise the effectiveness of the applied UV activation will diminish and the sections will not adhere properly to the slide. It is also important to regularly clean the glass surface of the curing platform with absolute alcohol to remove contaminants such as frost and dust–this will ensure maximum passage of the applied UV light.\n\n\n2.5.4 Tissue Shear\nWe have found that unless the embedding medium freezes to the same hardness as the tissue, tissue sections are likely to have shear artifacts. These will appear as local or global tears in the tissue. We have empirically found that Neg-50 (Richard Allen Scientific, 6506) outperforms O.C.T (Tissue-Tek, 4583) or other embedding mediums. With the use of Neg-50, this artifact has been largely eliminated.\n\n\n2.5.5 Application of UV\nThis system allows the user to select the duration of UV exposure per slide. For most samples, an exposure of 5 seconds will be sufficient. We suggest an exposure of 8–10 seconds for maximum consistency. An exposure of longer than ~30 seconds will make it difficult to peel the tape-window, and should be avoided. If tissue remains on the tape-window after peeling, exposure should be increased by a few seconds. If excessive force is needed to peel the tape-window, then the exposure should be reduced.\n\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164547/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164547/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102363/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n\t\t\t\tConcurrent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) was not uncommon in China.

We found that the overall distributions of the genotypes among the sustained virological response (SVR), NVR groups were significantly different (P<0.001):  patients with the rs8099917 TG genotype had an increased risk of NVR (odds ratio [OR] =2.37 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.16–4.83, P =0.017), and those with the GG genotype had a further increased risk of NVR (OR=4.23, 95% CI =1.17-15.3, P=0.027). The rs12979860 allele was also highly associated with treatment failure (CT/TT vs. CC; OR =2.04, 95%CI =1.05-3.97, P =0.037). Moreover, we found that IL28B rs8099917 G variants (TG+GG) interact with HCV genotype 1(G1) to result in higher risk of NVR (P=0.009), and that they are also associated with HBV DNA reactivation (TG+GG vs. TT, P=0.005). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis show that the rs8099917 G allele was the most important factor significantly associated with a NVR in HCV G1 patients. This study suggest that IL28B genotyping may be a valid pretreatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HBV dually-infected patients.\n\t\t\t"],"title":"Genetic Variation in Interleukin 28B and Response to Antiviral Therapy in Patients with Dual Chronic Infection with Hepatitis B and C Viruses"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077911/conclusions","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053120","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        The tropical root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus is a major pest of multiple crops in the Caribbean Islands and has become a serious constraint to citrus production in the United States. Recent work has identified host and conspecific volatiles that mediate host- and mate-finding by D. abbreviatus. The interaction of light, color, and odors has not been studied in this species. The responses of male and female D. abbreviatus to narrow bandwidths of visible light emitted by LEDs offered alone and in combination with olfactory stimuli were studied in a specially-designed multiple choice arena combined with a locomotion compensator. Weevils were more attracted to wavelengths close to green and yellow compared with blue or ultraviolet, but preferred red and darkness over green. Additionally, dim green light was preferred over brighter green. Adult weevils were also attracted to the odor of its citrus host + conspecifics. However, the attractiveness of citrus + conspecific odors disappeared in the presence of a green light. Photic stimulation induced males but not females to increase their speed. In the presence of light emitted by LEDs, turning speed decreased and path straightness increased, indicating that weevils tended to walk less tortuously. Diaprepes abbreviatus showed a hierarchy between chemo- and photo-taxis in the series of experiments presented herein, where the presence of the green light abolished upwind anemotaxis elicited by the pheromone + host plant odor. Insight into the strong responses to visual stimuli of chemically stimulated insects may be provided when the amount of information supplied by vision and olfaction is compared, as the information transmission capacity of compound eyes is estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared with the olfactory system. Subordination of olfactory responses by photic stimuli should be considered in the design of strategies aimed at management of such insects.\n      "],"title":"Olfactory Cues Are Subordinate to Visual Stimuli in a Neotropical Generalist Weevil","materials_and_methods":["\n        Insects\n        Newly emerged virgin adult D. abbreviatus were obtained from the U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory, Fort Pierce, FL, USA [4], [25]. Adults were identified by sex, and shipped overnight in individual plastic cups with a piece of moist dental wick to the Invasive Insect Biocontrol and Behavior Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, USA where the experiments were performed. Females and males were kept separately in groups of 20 in round plastic containers (height 25 cm, diameter 19 cm) in an environmental chamber at 25±1°C and 80±5% relative humidity. Adults were provided young leaves of Citrus macrophylla Wester until use. Illumination during the photophase (12 L:12 D) was provided by a fluorescent lamp (FG12180-A, General Electric, USA). Weevils tested between the second and fourth week after emergence were starved for approximately 24 hours prior to behavioral experiments. A 2 mm square of adhesive tape was placed on the elytra of weevils used in behavioral assays to prevent flight. Individuals were used only once.\n      \n        Servosphere\n        D. abbreviatus were tracked while walking on a servosphere (locomotion compensator) (Syntech LC-300, Hilversum, The Netherlands) [26], [27]. This tracking instrument allowed the untethered insect to walk unimpeded in all directions on the apex of a 30 cm diameter white sphere (Fig. 1). A movement detector based on active pixel sensor (APS) technology integrated with a near-infrared 8-LED (light-emitting diode) lamp (wavelength peak at 940 nm) was positioned 22 cm above the insect. The near-infrared lamp was integrated with the sensor and illuminated a field of 7 cm in diameter on the apex of the sphere. The signal from the movement detector was processed and sent to servo-motors that drove the sphere in the opposite direction of the insect’s movement in order to maintain its location at the apex of the sphere. Information on movements of the sphere was supplied to a computer by two pulse-generator encoders positioned orthogonally at the equator of the ball, thus allowing for reconstruction of tracks described by the insect’s movements. The movements were measured at a rate of 0.1/s with an accuracy of 0.1 mm.\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0053120.g001\n          Figure 1\n          \n            Choice arena adapted to a locomotion compensator (servosphere).\n            Schematic representation of a choice arena adapted to a servosphere where a Diaprepes abbreviatus weevil walking on the apex of the sphere was stimulated with light emitting diodes (LED) of different wavelengths and chemical stimuli. (A) The sphere compensated for the insect displacement so it remained on its apex (side view). Air passing through a bottle, that contains citrus or males feeding on citrus, carried odors to the weevil. Two different colored lights were presented in paired combinations with LEDs of the same color cue positioned in opposite arms (top view). (B) Walking response of D. abbreviatus adults exposed to colored LEDs in still air expressed as percentage of distance covered in each of four 90° angles projected to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° where 0° and 180° represent blue and 90° and 270° represent green. Relative displacement in the ‘x’ and ‘y’ corridors for this experiment is also showed in figure 2.

(C) Walking trajectories performed by a female (left) and a male (right) weevil stimulated with green and blue on the servosphere showed that both individuals oriented toward the green lights. Relative size of insects has been exaggerated for clarity.\n          \n          \n        \n      \n        Multiple Choice Arena\n        The observation system used in this study was tested previously with L. decemlineata [16], [24] and consisted of a modified version of a crossroad arena [28]. It comprised two perpendicular corridors (length 36 cm, wide 7 cm, height 14 cm) made of acrylic plastic (polymethyl methacrylate) walls (thick 5 mm) (Precision Plastics Inc, Beltsville, MD, USA) fitted over a servosphere but allowing the sphere to rotate freely underneath the corridors (Fig. 1). The two corridors bisected each other forming a cross with a square chamber at the apex of the servosphere which coincided with the field of view of the video sensor. The walking insect always rested within this chamber where it was exposed to the experimental stimuli but was unable to reach any of the four arms due to the motion compensation of the servosphere (open loop set up). The inner lateral walls of the arena corridors were covered with steel metal mirrors to avoid biases caused by shadows produced at the corners of the corridors. The top of each arm was covered with a black roof made of acrylic plastic. The central chamber top was left uncovered in order to track the insect movement with the video sensor and to allow odors to exit the arena (see Chemical stimuli).\n      \n        Photic Stimuli\n        Within the multiple choice arena, different pairs of monochromatic lights produced by light emitting diodes (LEDs, RadioShack, Fort Worth, TX, USA; LED Supply, Randolph, VT, USA) were offered during a two minute test period (Fig. 1). The optical axes of the light beams were directed towards the insect that walked on the apex of the sphere by positioning LEDs at an angle of 9° to the insect at the end of each of the four corridor arms (Fig. 1). LEDs were the only source of visible light in the experimental room, so they were perceived by the insect as spots of light in the dark. Intensity and wavelength of emitted light were measured with a spectrometer (USB4000; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA). The intensity of light emitted by each LED was regulated with a stimulator device (Grass S44 and S88; Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA, USA), so each LED emitted a photon intensity or flux [29] of approximately 1.55×1017 photons m−2 s−1. Green LEDs for low intensity light experiments emitted approximately 1.55×1010 photons m−2 s−1 (dim green). Colors emitted by LEDs had narrow wavelength bands that varied in width from 50 to 90 nm; these spectral bandwidth ranges were calculated from the two wavelengths on either side of the spectrum given at the intensity value that equals ½ of the peak value. The beam radiation pattern corresponded to a narrow-angled specular LED. Maximum peaks and centroid wavelengths did not differ by more than 5 nm, i.e., wavelength shapes were highly symmetric. Peak wavelengths tested occurred at 351 (ultraviolet), 472 (blue), 570 (green), 585 (yellow) and 660 nm (red) [16]. Color names correspond to the subjective visual sensation produced on the human eye by these wavelengths. Corridors not supplied with LEDs were dark.\n        Opposite arms were equipped with the same color cue at the end of each corridor to provide a symmetrical photic environment. Four stimulation points were used rather than two to produce two uniform fields of vision. Two LEDs would each produce two different stimuli differing in shape and intensity: the point source and the reflected light on the opposing wall. The insect would see the light emitted directly by a particular color LED, and the light reflected on the opposite wall of the arena that appears as a different shape and intensity. By using 4 LEDs (two opposite LEDs for each color in the perpendicular corridors), the insect was presented with two homogeneous sets of stimuli. The arrangement of corridors avoided reflection by the walls of the arena and the blending of the different colors being tested. The use of corridors reduced sources of reflected light, i.e., each corridor (‘x’ and ‘y’) channeled and separated the light reaching the insect from that reflected by the surroundings.\n      \n        Chemical Stimuli\n        Headspace odors were provided by 2.4 g of C. macrophylla leaves or 10 male D. abbreviatus feeding on similarly prepared C. macrophylla leaves placed in 500 ml glass gas-wash bottles (Fig. 1). Gas-wash bottles were left to equilibrate for at least 10 min before presenting volatiles in the headspace as the odor stimulus to the weevils. Insects were stimulated during a two-minute test period (see below). The odor delivery system consisted of a charcoal-filtered air-stream maintained at 25°C and 60–73% r.h. as measured by a hygro-thermometer (EA25, Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA; accuracy: ± 3% r.h. and ± 1°C) flowing at 6 l/min (30 ± 15 cm/s airspeed as measured by a hot-wire anemometer, model 441S, Kurtz, CA, USA; accuracy ± 0.01 m/s) that passed through a stainless steel tube (dia. 2 cm, length 4 cm). This tube was painted black, to exclude unexpected influences from asymmetries, and positioned on the horizontal plane tangent to the apex of the sphere, i.e., at an angle of 0° to the insect, and 18 cm from the insect at the end of one corridor of the multiple choice arena. A laminar flow over the insect was made by passing the airflow through a spongy steel insert within the tube. A second charcoal-filtered air-stream (Stimulus Controller CS-55, Syntech, The Netherlands) passing through the gas-wash bottle containing the odor sources was injected at 150 ml/min immediately downstream of the spongy steel, so the air from the flasks was diluted 40-fold in the main air stream. Note that this second air flow was set in order to assure that the stimulus was constant (i.e., not depleted) during the 2 minutes period of stimulation. During the chemo-stimulation period 300 ml out of 500 ml were displaced from the odor bottle. Additionally, > 15 minutes elapsed between experiments so insects and plants had time to emit more volatiles and bottles with odors were replaced after testing 10 insects. The control consisted of a clean gas-wash bottle; the headspace of this bottle was injected during the control periods through the second charcoal-filtered air-stream. The onset and cessation of the light stimulus to the insect was synchronized with that of the chemical stimulus by use of a solenoid valve. The experimental setup was positioned near an exhaust hood to remove odors from the laboratory arena.\n      \n        Behavioral Experiments\n        Two sets of experiments were performed. One set consisted of experiments in which each insect was given a choice between two monochromatic LED pairs in still air (group 1). Responses of weevils to colored lights were recorded for 3 min [16]. The other set of experiments comprised 4 series of bioassays (group 2). In the first series, weevils were stimulated during the test period with air that had passed over the headspace of citrus leaves (series I: citrus alone) and in the second series, weevils were stimulated with air that had passed over male weevils feeding on citrus leaves (series II: citrus + males). In a third experimental series, weevils were stimulated with colored LEDs during the test period; a blue LED was placed above the tube that served as source of clean air that stimulated the insect and another blue LED was placed on the opposite arm of this corridor, while the other two arms were provided with a green LED each (series III: clean air + blue vs. green). Finally, the insect was simultaneously subjected to chemical and photic stimuli (series IV: citrus + males + blue vs. green) during the test period. In this series, each insect was given the choice between a blue LED + volatiles from males feeding on citrus versus another opposite blue LED and two green LEDs; blue and green LEDs were positioned as in series III. In all experiments, LEDs were the only source of illumination in the room. Responses were recorded for three consecutive 2-min periods [24]: in the air stream alone (control), in the air stream plus other experimental stimuli (test), and in the air stream after removal of the experimental stimuli (end-control). The eolic stimulation (air stream) was supplied during control, test, and end-control periods, but chemical and photic stimuli were only supplied during the test period. Experiments were performed during insect photophase, in a dark room at 25±0.5°C and 40±10% RH as measured by a hygro-thermometer (EA25, Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA, accuracy: ± 3% r.h. and ± 1°C). To control for unexpected influences from asymmetries or bias within the apparatus and room, the colors were changed between the corridors after testing half of the insects. Each of the four experimental series was run with both females and males. As D. abbreviatus can be reluctant to move for several hours after being manipulated, most weevils were induced to walk by touching the tarsus of a metathoracic leg with forceps for less than one second. Insects manipulated in such a manner often walked continuously on the servosphere for hours. After this evasive response, each insect was allowed to adapt to the servosphere by walking during ≥5 min before starting a recording to allow it to acclimate to the experimental conditions, i.e. diminish any stress caused by the experimental procedures. Insects that failed to walk were discarded (approximately 10%).\n      \n        Track Analysis\n        The x-y coordinates provided by the servosphere at intervals of 0.1 s were merged in step-sizes of 10 units for more efficient summarizing of the tracks [30], [31]. This merger provided step-size intervals of 1 s which allowed the insect to move at least 50% of its length before recording its next position. This merger of intervals took into account that the mean length of D. abbreviatus reared with F1675 artificial diet was approximately 20 mm [25] and its average speed was approximately 20 mm/s. This step-size was large enough to reduce noise produced by insect movements such as wobbling while walking. Instantaneous displacement and direction were computed from the position changes within each interval. Kinematic parameters such as speed (i.e., magnitude of velocity), linearity, path straightness and turning velocity were calculated from instantaneous values using previously developed equations [32], [33]. Linearity was calculated by dividing displacement (distance in a straight line from origin to end point) and walking distance. Path straightness was calculated as the length of the circular mean vector that describes the weevil’s path. Both linearity and path straightness served to measure tortuosity of the path. Walking tracks were reconstructed by plotting the cumulative addition of consecutive positions. To identify stops, 3 mm/s was considered the minimum speed D. abbreviatus had to achieve to be considered walking; values below this speed were produced by other movements such as grooming the antennae or legs. Speed, turning speed and path straightness indices for each series were calculated as each insect’s average parameter during the test period minus its average parameter during the control period.\n      \n        Characterization of Weevil Orientation\n        Two methods were used to characterize weevil orientation responses according to the number of choices offered to each individual in order to facilitate presentation of the data. Relative displacement in the ‘x’ and ‘y’ corridors was compared to evaluate response during 3 minute runs when offered the choice of two pairs of colored LED lights. This system allowed for comparison of all experiments where colors were evaluated. To characterize the effects of chemical and photic stimuli on weevil orientation (i.e., four choices) each arm within the arena was assigned with an arbitrary angle of 45° either side of each stimulus. In the “multimodal experiments” where more than two choices were offered, we considered that a weevil chose a particular corridor (0°, 90°, 180° or 270° directions) when it walked into the corresponding area described by the cardinal direction ± 30°. Percentage of displacement within cones defined by these angles was calculated for each 2-min track (control, test and end-control periods).\n      \n        Statistics\n        Equality of variance was tested with Levene’s test and normality of the residuals of models was analyzed within each treatment with Shapiro-Wilk’s W test Shapiro-Wilk and QQ normal plot method [34], [35]. When residuals of our model followed a normal distribution and showed homoscedasticity, they were analyzed with ANOVA and t-test; otherwise, they were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon (paired and unpaired) and Dunn’s post-hoc tests (α = 0.05). Interquartile range (IQR) was used as a measure of statistical dispersion when residuals did not follow a normal distribution, being equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. The effect of stimulation on orientation and kinematic responses was also evaluated by using indices representing the difference between the data obtained for the test and the previous control period for each treatment. Post-hoc multiple comparisons were done when a Kruskal–Wallis test was significant [36]. Data were combined when females and males did not differ in behavioral responses. Results were considered significant at the 5% level; significance levels (P) were given in approximate values to facilitate reader comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using R software version 2.12.2 (2011-02-25), Vienna, Austria [37].\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015953/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015953/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/references","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/body","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/introduction","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139816/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040813/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176838/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077910","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nHigh-throughput sequencing technology, also called next-generation sequencing (NGS), has the potential to revolutionize the whole process of genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and epigenetics. Sequencing data is captured in a public primary data archive, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). As of January 2013, data from more than 14,000 projects have been submitted to SRA, which is double that of the previous year. Researchers can download raw sequence data from SRA website to perform further analyses and to compare with their own data. However, it is extremely difficult to search entries and download raw sequences of interests with SRA because the data structure is complicated, and experimental conditions along with raw sequences are partly described in natural language. Additionally, some sequences are of inconsistent quality because anyone can submit sequencing data to SRA with no quality check. Therefore, as a criterion of data quality, we focused on SRA entries that were cited in journal articles. We extracted SRA IDs and PubMed IDs (PMIDs) from SRA and full-text versions of journal articles and retrieved 2748 SRA ID-PMID pairs. We constructed a publication list referring to SRA entries. Since, one of the main themes of -omics analyses is clarification of disease mechanisms, we also characterized SRA entries by disease keywords, according to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) extracted from articles assigned to each SRA entry. We obtained 989 SRA ID-MeSH disease term pairs, and constructed a disease list referring to SRA data. We previously developed feature profiles of diseases in a system called “Gendoo”. We generated hyperlinks between diseases extracted from SRA and the feature profiles of it. The developed project, publication and disease lists resulting from this study are available at our web service, called “DBCLS SRA” (http://sra.dbcls.jp/). This service will improve accessibility to high-quality data from SRA.\n"],"title":"Experimental Design-Based Functional Mining and Characterization of High-Throughput Sequencing Data in the Sequence Read Archive","materials_and_methods":["\nIndexing each submission to a corresponding project in SRA database\nWe downloaded all of the metadata in the SRA database from the DDBJ FTP site (ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/dra/) in March 2012. The experimental information including sequencing platforms and species of samples are separately recorded in six types of XML files: submission, study, experiment, run, sample and analysis (Figure S1). However, in the SRA database, each submission has not all those objects of metadata (Figure 1). The relationships between objects are often one-to-many, and raw sequence data under a same project is archived to separate directories. Since the corresponding IDs of other types of objects are described in each file as a reference link, we extracted each type of SRA ID (e.g., SRP000001 for “study”, SRX000001 for “experiment”, and SRS000001 for “samples”) from the metadata XML files and determined the connections among corresponding IDs. Accordingly, we constructed an ID mapping table.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077910.g001Figure 1\nThe presence or absence of six objects of Sequence Read Archive (SRA) metadata for each submission (top 15).\nThe experimental designs including project titles, sequencing platforms and sample species are archived in SRA along with raw sequence data as six types of XML files: submission, study, experiment, run, sample and analysis. Analysis files are optional for submission. Each submission has not all those objects of metadata.\n\nArticles extraction related to each SRA entry\nWe constructed a publication list that refers SRA data to assist to access high-throughput sequencing data of sufficiently high quality for analysis. A schematic view of the pipeline for generating SRA-PMID pairs is shown in Figure S2. We first retrieved the PubMed IDs (PMIDs) cited in the reference sections of the entire downloaded SRA metadata. Next, we extracted SRA IDs from journal articles in MEDLINE. Many IDs of external databases, including GenBank and OMIM, referred to in journal articles are cited in the external database section of MEDLINE, but the SRA IDs are not contained in this section. Therefore, we extracted SRA IDs from the full-text versions of articles in PubMed Central (PMC) and the websites of the journals that were freely available for parsing using regular expression pattern matching. In particular, we focused on articles assigned with MeSH term of “High-throughput Nucleotide Sequencing”. The SRA IDs extracted from journal articles are often not the same IDs used for submissions (i.e., start from SRA, ERA and DRA) or study (i.e. SRP, ERP and DRP), but are the IDs used for experiment (start from SRX, ERX and DRX) or run (SRR, ERR and DRR). Thus, we converted the extracted IDs to the corresponding SRA study IDs by the ID mapping table previously constructed.\nSome transcriptome data captured by massively parallel sequencers are submitted not only to SRA but also to the GEO, and reference articles often cite GEO IDs as links to the captured data. Therefore, in addition to SRA IDs, we retrieved the GEO IDs and their corresponding referring PMIDs, using the same methods as described above, from the entire set of GEO data downloaded from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geo/), and PMC article data. Referred GEO IDs contain a GEO dataset start from GDS, and the GEO series has a prefix of GSE. To convert the GEO IDs to the corresponding SRA IDs, we extracted SRA IDs from the GEO data and GEO IDs from the SRA metadata, and then constructed pairs of SRA and GEO IDs. Accordingly, we constructed a publication list referring to SRA data, showing publication title, journal name, PMID and referring SRA ID and data title.\n\nCharacterization of each SRA entry by disease keywords\nTo characterize each SRA entry by other criteria, we used the MeSH controlled vocabulary. MeSH contains more than 23,000 keywords and hierarchically categorized into 15 concepts including “disease”, “chemicals and drugs”, and “anatomy”. It is originally curated for indexing MEDLINE articles by NLM.\nWe obtained MeSH terms (2012 release) from the NLM website (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). We extracted assigned MeSH terms from retrieved journal articles, and then constructed pairs of SRA IDs and MeSH terms. We divided these SRA-MeSH pairs according to MeSH categories, such as diseases and chemicals, and obtained disease-relevant SRA entries by restricting these pairs to MeSH terms belonging to the \"Disease\" [C] branch or \"Mental Disorders\" [F03] sub-branch. To visualize the associations between SRA entries and relevant MeSH terms, we developed an association list showing the SRA IDs, SRA titles, relevant diseases and PMIDs from the source articles. We also generated a frequency list, according to the number of SRA entries associated with each disease, which allows researchers to restrict the list to a sub-category of disease, including neoplasms and mental disorders.\nWe previously constructed feature profiles of diseases referred to in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) entries [8] by extracting disease MeSH terms from journal articles related to each OMIM entry. The feature profiles are available at our web service, which is called the Gene and Disease Features Ontology-based Overview System (Gendoo) (http://gendoo.dbcls.jp/) [9], [10]. We generated hyperlinks to corresponding Gendoo entries for each disease in the generated SRA-disease list by converting MeSH terms to their corresponding OMIM entries with Disease Ontology (DO) [11]; these were released in September 2012.\nDiseases are often referred to by lexical variations, such as \"lung cancer\" and \"lung neoplasms\". To cope with this multiplicity of terms, we constructed a hierarchical tree view of MeSH disease terms so that researchers can search for SRA entries associated with a particular disease by referring to the MeSH hierarchy.\n\nWebsite implementation\nWe developed the web service called DBCLS SRA to make public high-throughput sequencing data more searchable and usable. DBCLS SRA provides a project list categorized by study types, sequencing platforms, and sample species.

Sera of 133 patients were tested for mumps-specific antibodies by ELISA and 15 nose/throat swabs were investigated for mumps virus RNA by RT-PCR. IgG antibodies were found in 127 patients (95.5%). Mumps infection was laboratory-confirmed in 53 patients, including 44 IgM and 9 PCR positive cases. All other 282 cases were classified as epidemiologically-confirmed. More than half of the patients (n = 181, 54%) were 20–29 years old, followed by the 15–19 age bracket (n = 95, 28.4%). Twice as many males as females were affected (67% versus 33%). Disease complications were reported in 13 cases (3.9%), including 9 patients with orchitis and 4 with pancreatitis. According to medical records or anamnestic data, 190 patients (56.7%) were immunized with two doses and 35 (10.4%) with one dose of mumps-containing vaccine. The Serbian sequences corresponded to a minor genotype G variant detected during the 2011/2012 mumps outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vaccine failures, the initial one-dose immunization policy and a vaccine shortage between 1999 and 2002 contributed to the outbreak. Additional vaccination opportunities should be offered to young adults during transition periods in their life trajectories.\n"],"title":"A Mumps Outbreak in Vojvodina, Serbia, in 2012 Underlines the Need for Additional Vaccination Opportunities for Young Adults","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nThe physicians at the health centers were responsible for the clinical diagnosis of the parotitis cases. The investigation of this outbreak was done in the frame of non-research national public health surveillance for mumps and did not comprise any previously planned activities that could have been reviewed by an ethics committee or institutional review board. Sample collection was done for laboratory diagnosis as part of standard patient care and did therefore not require written informed consent. Clinical specimens were collected only if the patient provided oral consent.\nThe epidemiological staff of the Public Health Service of Vojvodina recorded patient data including date of birth, gender, place of residence, clinical symptoms, date of symptom onset, immunization status and disease complications. Data were reported on a weekly basis from the health centers to the Public Health Service of Vojvodina where descriptive epidemiological methods were used to process, evaluate and analyze all available patient data. Access to patient data was restricted to people directly involved in diagnosis and reporting to the treating physician.\n\nCase Definitions\nAccording to the WHO criteria, a clinical case in the 2012 mumps outbreak was defined as a person with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland, lasting two or more days without other apparent cause [6]. A laboratory-confirmed case was defined as a clinical case of parotitis confirmed serologically and/or by molecular techniques. An epidemiologically confirmed case meets the clinical case definition and has an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case [6]. An imported case of mumps was defined as a clinical case epidemiologically linked to a mumps case in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the maximum length of the incubation period and an import-related case was defined as a person meeting the clinical criteria who has a direct epidemiological link to an imported case of mumps.\n\nPatient Samples\nSerum samples from 133 patients presenting with parotitis were collected 1–14 days after the onset of disease for serological diagnosis. Convalescent sera were obtained from 10 patients 7–14 days following the first serum sample. For molecular analysis nose/throat swabs were collected from 15 patients 1–5 days after disease onset and from 13 of these patients also serum samples were available for antibody detection (Fig 1).\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0139815.g001\nFig 1\n\nTesting algorithm of clinical samples.\n\n\n\n\nSerology\nSera of 133 patients were tested at the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina. Determination of MuV specific IgM and IgG antibodies was done using EUROIMMUN AG IgM and IgG assays (Lübeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sera of the 13 patients of whom also nose/throat swabs were available, were investigated at Institute Torlak using Enzygnost anti-parotitis virus IgM and IgG kits (Siemens, Marburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nMolecular Diagnosis\nDetection of MuV RNA was done by Real-time PCR at Institute Torlak. RNA was extracted from nose/throat samples using a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For MuV detection a Real-time PCR was done using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit (Hilden, Germany) and primers and probes provided by the Statens Institute, Denmark (MP1- f: 5'- CATAGGRGAYATGTGGGGACCAACCATT-3’; MP2 –r: 5'- GTCTTCGCCAACGATGGTGATGATTG-3’; MP probe: 5'-FAM-CCATGCAGGCGGTCACATTCCRACAACTGC-TAMRA-3’, Nielsen LP, Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, 2009, unpublished).

This is probably due to increased awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, and the availability of a genetic test for this condition. Most of these referred patients were over-weight middle-aged men with elevated ferritin levels, but without the hemochromatosis-predisposing gene mutations. We evaluated the relationship between hyperferritinemia and the metabolic syndrome in 40 patients. Methods: Forty consecutive patients referred for hyperferritinemia were investigated. The examination programme included medical history, clinical investigation and venous blood samples drawn after an overnight fast. This resulted in 34 patients with unexplained hyperferritinemia, which were further examined. Liver biopsy was successfully performed in 29 subjects. Liver iron stores were assessed morphologically, and by quantitative phlebotomy in 16 patients. Results: The majority of the patients had markers of the metabolic syndrome, and 18 patients (52%) fulfilled the IDF-criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Mean body mass index was elevated (28,8±4,2), mean diastolic blood pressure was 88,5±10,5 mmHg, and mean fasting insulin C-peptide 1498±539 pmol/l. Liver histology showed steatosis and nuclear glycogen inclusions in most patients (19 out of 29). Only four patients had increased iron stores by histology, of which two could be explained by alcohol consumption. Fourteen of 16 patients normalized ferritin levels after phlebotomy of a cumulative blood amount corresponding to normal iron stores. Ferritin levels were significantly related to insulin C-peptide level (p<0.002) and age (p<0.002). Conclusion: The present results suggest that liver steatosis and insulin resistance but not increased iron load is frequently seen in patients referred for suspected hemochromatosis on the basis of hyperferritinemia. The ferritin level seems to be positively associated to insulin resistance. "],"title":"Hyperferritinemia Is Associated with Insulin Resistance and Fatty Liver in Patients without Iron Overload","materials_and_methods":["\nPatients\nDuring 2001 40 patients were referred to the hematology clinic at Aalesund Hospital due to elevated ferritin levels and suspicion of hemochromatosis. This is an observational study with retrospective analysis of the results of the examination programme. All patients gave oral consent to the examination programme. Due to the retrospective observational nature of the study, the Regional ethics committee of Mid-Norway had no comment to the study, and as the examinations themselves were part of a clinical quality assurance program, they did not need formal approval from the ethics committee. However, all patients gave oral consent to the use of clinical data for research purposes.\nFive patients had hereditary hemochromatosis and one had hemosiderosis secondary to excessive iron intake. Hence 34 patients (33males, 1 female) had no hfe-mutation known to predispose for hemochromatosis (neither homozygous for C282Y nor compound heterozygous, i.e. heterozygous for both C282Y and H63D) and was further examined to reveal other causes for hyperferritinemia.\n\nExaminations\nA structured examination programme was performed including medical history, clinical examination, laboratory tests and liver biopsy. Reason for taking liver biopsy was hyperferritinemia/elevated liver transaminases where examinations so far had not given any explanation for the deviations. Examinations did not deviate from what is usually recommended for follow-up of such patients. The HUNT-study [10] was used as reference population regarding BMI (women; 26.4 kg/m2, men; 26.5 kg/m2), waist-hip ratio (women; 0.77±0.06, men; 0.89±0.06), systolic blood pressure (women; 136.8 mmHg, men; 140.1 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (women; 78.8 mmHg, men; 81.9 mmHg).\n\nLaboratory tests\nVenous blood samples were drawn after overnight fast.\nS-iron (reference values, women; 11–23 µmol/l, men; 14–29 µmol) was analysed using Colorimetric assay (CFAS-Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Serum-glucose (reference value 3.6–5.8 mmol/l), aspartate amino tranferase (AST) (reference values, women; <35 U/l, men; <50 U/l), alanine amino transferase (ALT) (reference values, women; <35 U/l, men; <50 U) were measured by UV-test (CFAS-Roche, Mannheim, Germany). C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by a turbidimetric method (CFAS-Roche, reference value <6 mg/l). Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) (reference value, 3.5–6.5%) used ion-change-chromatography (HPLC-Biorad Variant Hb testing system, Marnes-La-Cocuette, France). Ferritin (reference values, women; 10–250 µg/l, men; 20–250 µg/l) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC)(reference value 46–80 µmol/l) were analyzed by nephelometry (Dade Behring. Marburg, Germany). Transferrin saturation (%) = s-iron/TIBCx100 (reference value, 15–45%). Fasting insulin C-peptide (reference value 240–720 pmol/l) was analysed by chemiluminescence method (DPC-immulite. Liamberis, Gwynodd, LL55 4EL, UK). HFE mutation was analyzed measuring fragment-length polymorphisms by PCR [1].\nLiver biopsies were ultrasound-guided with 18-Gauge needles. Iron content was evaluated according to Rowe [11]: Grade 0–1 is within normal limits, and grades 2+ to 4+ represent distinct iron increase (70–850 µmol/g dry weight).\n\nPhlebotomy\nIron stores were also estimated by quantitative phlebotomy in 16 patients. One gram of hemoglobin contains 3.4 mg iron, and the amount of iron removed by phlebotomy can thus be calculated [12]–[13]. The normal amount of storage iron in males, measured by quantitative phlebotomy, has been shown to be about 750 mg [14]–[15].\n\nDefinitions\nThere have been several definitions of the metabolic syndrome (WHO 1999/NCEP 2001)[16]–[17]. We used the recent simplified definition recommended by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), which emphasizes waist circumference (women; >80 cm, men; >94 cm) in addition to minimum 2 of the following criteria: HDL-cholesterol <1.03 mmol/l (men), blood pressure >130/85 mmHg, triglycerides >1.7 mmol/l, or fasting blood glucose >5.6 mmol/l [18].\n\nStatistical analyses\nNormal distribution of data was verified by normality plots. All normally distributed measurements are presented as mean and standard deviations (SD), otherwise median and range were used. Comparisons of normal distributed parameters were done by t-tests. Univariate and multiple forward linear regression analyses were used to investigate relations between s-ferritin and other variables. Logaritmic transformation of s-transferrin was used to obtain normal distribution. All tests were 2-sided, and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. No adjustments for multiple testing were performed. All analyses were performed with SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc, USA).\n\nRole of funding source\nThe funding source had no involvment in the conduction of the study.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003547/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nNeuroinflammation is involved in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including brain infections, ischemia, trauma, stroke, and degenerative CNS diseases. In the CNS inflammation, secretory phospholipase A2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA) acts as a mediator, resulting in the generation of the precursors of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). However, the role of sPLA2-IIA in neuroinflammation is more complicated and remains unclear yet. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sPLA2-IIA inhibition by specific inhibitor SC-215 on the inflammation in LPS-induced mice cerebral cortex and primary astrocytes. Our results showed that the inhibition of sPLA2-IIA alleviated the release of PGE2 by suppressing the activation of ERK1/2, cPLA2α, COX-2 and mPGES-1. These findings demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA showed the potential to regulate the neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro, indicating that sPLA2-IIA might be a novel target for the treatment of acute neuroinflammation.\n"],"title":"Inhibition of sPLA2-IIA Prevents LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation by Suppressing ERK1/2-cPLA2α Pathway in Mice Cerebral Cortex","materials_and_methods":["\nMaterials\nThe following chemicals and materials were purchased, LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), the specific group IIA sPLA2 inhibitor, SC-215 (Santa Cruz, California, USA), cPLA2α inhibitor, AACOCF3 (Calbiochem, SanDiego, CA), antibody against sPLA2-IIA (BioVendor, Candler, NC), antibody against phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 and cPLA2α, and the total protein, COX-2, mPGES-1 (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal antibody for astrocytes (Bioss, Beijing), the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor(SB203580), the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor (U0126) (Sigma Chemical Co.

Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Company. Mice were housed in polypropylene cages and maintained at 21°C under a reverse-phase 12 h light,12 h dark cycle with free access to water and rodent chow. All the protocols of experiments were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee of Shandong University and performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health.\nIntracerebroventricle microinjection was performed as previously described [24] with minor modifications. LPS was dissolved in sterile normal saline at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. On test day, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. The scalp was shaved and sterilized and a burr hole was drilled according to the following coordinates: 2.0 mm lateral to the midline and 1 mm caudal to bregma. Mice were received i.c.v. injection with 2.5 µg LPS [25] or subjected to i.c.v. injection with 1.218 µg SC-215901 1 hour before the LPS injection using a Harvard Apparatus syringe pump Mice in vehicle control group received i.c.v. injection with 2.5 µL saline or 2 µL DMSO. The concentration of LPS and SC-215 was identified to induce optimal responses in preliminary experiments and has been used by a number of other laboratories [26].The solutions were injected into the ventricle over a 2-min period, and the needle was left in the injection site for 4 minutes before it was slowly removed. The wound was sutured and the mice were euthanized at various time (10, 20, 30, 60 minutes) thereafter and the brains were removed, dissected and stored at −80°C.\n\nPrimary astrocyte cultures\nPrimary astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cortices of 0 to 1-day-old Wistar rat pups as previously described [27] with minor modifications. Briefly, cerebral cortices were dissected and meninges were removed in Petri dishes with D-Hanks balanced salt solution. The tissues were thoroughly diced with scalpels and suspended in 10 volumes 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The same volume contains 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in high glucose DMEM was added to stop cleavage. After centrifugation (5 min, 200 g, 25°C), the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dispersed in new medium containing high glucose DMEM (added 5.5 mM glucose) with addition of 20% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Then, the cell suspension was filter through 85 µm nylon mesh and transferred to poly-L-lysine coated 75 cm2 culture flasks. The culture medium was changed after 24 h and then every 3 days afterwards. When the cells became confluent after 2 weeks of culturing, flasks were shaken at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker at 37°C for 3 h to remove non-astrocyte cells. Cells were >95% positive for GFAP, the astrocytic marker. Cells were washed trypsinized and subcultured in 6-well (1.0×106) plates, selected cells were pretreated with varying concentrations of SC-215, U0126 or SB203580 for 2 hours. DMSO, at concentrations similar to comparative experiments, was used as an appropriate control and never exceeded 0.1%. Selected cells were then treated with LPS and the incubations ranged from 5 minutes to 240 minutes, as indicated in the text.\n\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis\nAfter incubation, media was removed and cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. Total RNA was prepared from cells by using the Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase originating from the Superscript™-III kit (Invitrogen) with 2.5 µg total RNA and oligo dT. The sequences of PCR primers were as follows: sPLA2-IIA, upper primer 5'-AAGGAAGCCGCACTCAGTTA-3' and lower primer 5'-GGCAGCAGCCTTATCACACT-3'; GAPDH, upper primer 5'-CAAGGTCATCCACGACCACT-3' and lower primer 5'-CCAGTGAGTTTCCCGTTCAG-3'. GAPDH expression was used as an internal calibrator for equal RNA loading and to normalize relative expression data for sPLA2-IIA gene analyzed.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein concentration was measured by using a BCA protein assay kit and loaded on the 10% Acrylamide-SDS-PAGE at 120 V in duplicates for electrophoresis and then transferred to NC (Nitrocellulose) membranes at 200 mA for one hour. Membranes were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% non-fat milk for one hour at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies against TLR4/CD284 (1∶1000), sPLA2-IIA (1∶500); phospho-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 (1∶10000), phospho-cPLA2α and cPLA2α (1∶1000) and GAPDH (1∶1000) overnight at 4°C. After washing with TBS-T, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies for one hour at room temperature. Immunolabeling was detected by ECL (Millipore). For quantification, blots were scanned and the band intensities were measured as optical density using the Quantity One program (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and normalized against GAPDH loading control.\n\nDetermination of PGE2 concentration\nSamples from the cortex were collected at different time as described above. The samples were weighted and homogenized. Then the PGE2 concentration of the supernatant was measured by means of ELISA-based assay (Cayman Chemical) [28].\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data are presented as means ± S.E.M. from three or more independent experiments. For time-response and SC-215 dose-response studies, statistical analysis was assessed by either Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests. For other expreriments, statistical analysis was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests to compare differences between the various treatment groups. In all cases, differences with p value < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077909/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127448/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028381","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Poorly regulated international trade in ornamental fishes poses risks to both biodiversity and economic activity via invasive alien species and exotic pathogens. Border security officials need robust tools to confirm identifications, often requiring hard-to-obtain taxonomic literature and expertise. DNA barcoding offers a potentially attractive tool for quarantine inspection, but has yet to be scrutinised for aquarium fishes. Here, we present a barcoding approach for ornamental cyprinid fishes by: (1) expanding current barcode reference libraries; (2) assessing barcode congruence with morphological identifications under numerous scenarios (e.g. inclusion of GenBank data, presence of singleton species, choice of analytical method); and (3) providing supplementary information to identify difficult species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We sampled 172 ornamental cyprinid fish species from the international trade, and provide data for 91 species currently unrepresented in reference libraries (GenBank/Bold). DNA barcodes were found to be highly congruent with our morphological assignments, achieving success rates of 90–99%, depending on the method used (neighbour-joining monophyly, bootstrap, nearest neighbour, GMYC, percent threshold). Inclusion of data from GenBank (additional 157 spp.) resulted in a more comprehensive library, but at a cost to success rate due to the increased number of singleton species. In addition to DNA barcodes, our study also provides supporting data in the form of specimen images, morphological characters, taxonomic bibliography, preserved vouchers, and nuclear rhodopsin sequences. Using this nuclear rhodopsin data we also uncovered evidence of interspecific hybridisation, and highlighted unrecognised diversity within popular aquarium species, including the endangered Indian barb Puntius denisonii. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that DNA barcoding provides a highly effective biosecurity tool for rapidly identifying ornamental fishes. In cases where DNA barcodes are unable to offer an identification, we improve on previous studies by consolidating supplementary information from multiple data sources, and empower biosecurity agencies to confidently identify high-risk fishes in the aquarium trade.

The non-cyprinid taxa Gyrinocheilus and Myxocyprinus were also included due to their ubiquity and superficial morphological similarity to some cyprinid fishes. Specimens were euthanised with MS-222 (tricaine methane sulfonate), before a tissue sample was excised from the right-hand caudal peduncle and stored at C in 100% ethanol. Specimens were subsequently formalin fixed and preserved in 70% ethanol as vouchers, following procedures outlined by Kottelat and Freyhof [51]. At least one specimen from each sample was photographed alive (left-hand side) prior to tissue sampling, with the remainder photographed after preservation. Voucher specimens for each COI barcode were deposited at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (ZRC), National University of Singapore.\n        Specimens were identified morphologically using scientific literature relevant to the group, and original descriptions were consulted where possible. The use of “sp.”, “cf.” and “aff.” notation in reference specimen identification follows Kottelat and Freyhof [51]. For analytical purposes, individuals designated “cf.” are treated as conspecific with taxa of the same specific name, while those designated “aff.” are treated as non-conspecific. Nomenclature follows Eschmeyer [52], unless otherwise stated. To assess the coverage of the project, a list of species believed to be in the aquarium trade was consulted as the most up-to-date and accurate guide available at this time [20]; we also used the MAF Biosecurity New Zealand Import Health Standard list of species [25].\n        Whenever possible, multiple individuals of each species were sampled. In order to better assess intraspecific genetic diversity, we tried to purchase multiple specimens at different times and from different vendors. Sampling efficiency was tested by correlating the number of haplotypes observed in each species with the number of individuals collected and the number of samples taken. For this purpose, a sample was considered as all conspecific specimens acquired from the same holding tank at the same premises on the same visit. These analyses were carried out in R version 2.12.1 [53], using a generalised, linear regression model with poisson distributions for count data; singleton species (species represented by one individual) were omitted.\n      \n        DNA Protocols\n        Approximately 2–3 mm of white muscle tissue was prepared for genomic DNA extraction using the Quick-gDNA spin-column kit (Zymo Research Corporation) following the manufacturer's protocol, but scaled to use a 50% volume of pre-elution reagents. Optimised PCR reactions were carried out using a GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) in 10 l reactions. Amplification of the COI barcode marker comprised reactions of the following reagents: 2.385 l ultrapure water; 1.0 l Expand High Fidelity  PCR buffer (Roche Diagnostics); 0.54 l MgCl (25.0 mM); 2.0 l dNTPs (1.0 mM); 1.5 l forward and reverse primer (2.0 M); 1.0 l DNA template; 0.075 l Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The COI fragment was amplified using one of the following primer pairs: FishF1 and FishR1 [54], LCO1490 and HCO2198 [55], or LCO1490A and HCO2198A [56]. Thermocycler settings for COI amplification were as follows: 2 min at 94C; 40 cycles of 15 s at 94.0C, 30 s at 48.0–52.0C and 45 s at 72.0C; 7 min at 72.0C;  at 4.0C.\n        The nuclear RHO data were generated as per the COI protocol, but using the primers RH28F [57] and RH1039R [58], and the following reagents: 1.7 l ultrapure water; 1.0 l Expand High Fidelity  PCR buffer (Roche Diagnostics); 2.0 l Q-Solution (Qiagen); 0.2 l MgCl (25.0 mM); 2.0 l dNTPs (1.0 mM); 1.0 l forward and reverse primer (2.0 M); 1.0 l DNA template; 0.1 l Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). Thermocycler settings for RHO amplification were as follows: 4 min at 94.0C; 40 cycles of 20 s at 94.0C, 30 s at 54.0–56.0C and 60 s at 72.0C; 7 min at 72.0C;  at 4.0C.\n        Prior to sequencing, PCR products were checked visually for quality and length conformity on a 1% agarose gel. Bidirectional sequencing was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol on a Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The same primer combinations as for PCR amplification were used for sequencing. Sequencing products were purified using the Agencourt CleanSEQ system (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Steps undertaken here to avoid or identify cross-amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs) are outlined by Buhay [59] and Song et al. [60]. Sequence chromatograms were inspected visually for quality and exported using FinchTV 1.4 (Geospiza). Trimmed nucleotide sequences were aligned according to the translated vertebrate mitochondrial amino acid code in the program Mega 4.1 [61]. The resulting COI fragment comprised a sequence read length of 651 base pairs (bp), positionally homologous to nucleotides 6,476 through 7,126 of the Danio rerio mitochondrial genome presented by Broughton et al. [62]. The RHO fragment corresponded to an 858 bp length (sites 58–915) of the Astyanax mexicanus rhodopsin gene, GenBank accession U12328 [44], [63]. For COI and RHO, sequence data, chromatogram trace files, images and supplementary information were uploaded to Bold, and are available in the “Ornamental Cyprinidae” [RCYY] project. In addition to sequence data generated here, public databases including GenBank and Bold were searched under the following terms: “Cyprinidae”, “COI”, “CO1” and “COX1”. Records were retained if the taxon in question was believed to occur in the aquarium trade [20], or if congeneric to a species we had already collected in our sampling. To facilitate analysis, nomenclature and spellings of GenBank/Bold records were updated or corrected following Eschmeyer [52].\n      \n        Analysis\n        The suitability of COI barcodes as a species identification tool was tested using five primary metrics, thereby quantifying different properties of the data. Rather than simply providing a species-based descriptive summary, we simulated a real identification problem for a biosecurity official by treating each individual as an identification query. In effect, this means that each sequence is considered an unknown while the remaining sequences in the dataset constitute the DNA barcoding database that is used for identification. Identification rates for these queries were divided into four categories: “correct” or “incorrect”, and “no identification” or “ambiguous” if applicable to the method. The extent to which rare, singleton specimens (one specimen per species) affect identification success rates is rarely explored, and is a problem for DNA barcode identification systems [42]. As few taxon-specific barcoding projects (i.e., databases) are complete [42], we aim to examine how the data perform for these singletons. It is therefore important for our analyses to distinguish between two identification scenarios. First, a query specimen belongs to a species that has already been barcoded and whose DNA barcode is maintained in a DNA barcoding database. Once sequenced, the best identification result for such a specimen is a “correct identification”. Second, the query specimen belongs to a species that remains to be barcoded (it is a singleton). The best result here is “no identification”, since the specimen has no conspecific barcode match in the database. The best overall identification technique is one that maximises identification success for scenario one, and yields a “no identification” result under scenario two. In light of this, we report results with both singleton species included (scenario two) and excluded (scenario one). When the analyses were carried out, however, the singletons remained in all datasets as possible matches for non-singletons. We term the success rates for scenario one (singletons excluded) as the “re-identification rate”.\n        Unless otherwise stated, all descriptive statistics and analyses were conducted using Spider, Brown et al.'s DNA barcode analysis package for R [64], [65]. Distance matrices and neighbour-joining (NJ) phylograms were generated under Kimura's two-parameter model (K2P/K80), with missing data treated under the “pairwise deletion” option. The K2P model was only used here to ensure consistency and comparability with other barcoding studies, but see Collins et al. [66] and Srivathsan and Meier [67] for more general discussion on the applicability of the K2P model. Negative branch lengths were set to zero [68], [69]. Terminology of topological relationships follows phylogenetic nomenclature consistent with literature but applies only to the gene tree relationships (e.g. monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly). NJ phylograms were rendered in Web-based jsPhyloSVG format [70], following conversion from Nexus format into phyloXML using Archaeopteryx [71]. This creates an interactive vector-graphic phylogram with links to specimen database records and supplementary data (e.g. images) via embedded URLs.\n        The five primary metrics measuring identification success rates in this study are described as follows: (1) We employed a tree-based test of species monophyly, with this measurement reporting the exclusivity of the genetic clusters in an NJ phylogram. The procedure returns each species as either monophyletic (correct identification), non-monophyletic (incorrect identification) or singleton (incorrect identification). This per-species measure was then scaled to include the number of individuals in each species. We also incorporated a bootstrap test of node support, with correct identifications scored if values were greater than 70% [72]; 1,000 replications and codon resample constraints (block  option) were used for the bootstrap analysis. (2) A test using the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) or “best match” classification approach [37], [73] was employed on the K2P distance matrix. A nearest neighbour () conspecific with the query returned a correct identification, otherwise an incorrect identification; singletons were reported as an incorrect identification, and ties were broken by majority, followed by random assignment. (3) We used the “best close match” (BCM) method presented by Meier et al. [37]. In BCM, ties are reported as ambiguous and matches must be within a pre-specified threshold value (i.e., 1%) otherwise no identification is returned [37]. (4) Fourthly, the data were tested with a technique approximating the threshold method used by the Bold-IDS identification engine [28]. Bold-IDS will return a positive identification if a query shares a  similar unambiguous match with a reference specimen [28]. Here, data were tested on a per-individual basis, using the K2P distance matrix. A correct identification was returned if all distances within 1% of the query were conspecific, an incorrect identification resulted when all distances within the threshold were different species, while an ambiguous identification result was given when multiple species, including the correct species, were present within the threshold. This method is similar to BCM, but operates upon all matches within the threshold, rather than just nearest neighbour matches.\n        Lastly, we used a method incorporating an estimation of group membership; the general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) models the probability of transition between speciation-level (Yule model) and population-level (coalescent model) processes of lineage branching [74], [75]. This offers a likelihood based test of biological pattern in the data, i.e., approximating the “barcoding gap” of intraspecific versus interspecific variation. Following Monaghan et al. [75], data were reduced to haplotypes using Alter [76], with gaps treated as missing data (ambiguous bases were first transformed to gap characters). Next, ultrametric chronograms were generated in Beast v1.6.1 [77], [78] under the following settings: site models as suggested by the BIC in jModelTest [79], [80]; strict molecular clock;  Yule tree prior; two independent MCMC chains with random starting topologies; chain length 20 million; total 20,000 trees; burn-in 10%; all other settings and priors default. The GMYC model was fitted in the Splits package for R [75], using the single threshold method under default settings. An individual was scored as a correct identification if it formed a GMYC cluster with at least one other conspecific individual. An incorrect identification was made when an individual clustered with members of other species, and a “no identification” was made when an individual formed a single entity (did not cluster with anything else). Exploratory results (data not shown) suggested that more sophisticated Beast and GMYC analyses using relaxed clocks, codon partitioned site models, outgroups, and multiple threshold GMYC resulted in a poorer fit to the morphologically identified species names, as did a full dataset (sequences not collapsed into haplotypes).\n        The use of a universal (e.g. 1%) threshold has been questioned repeatedly [37], [41], [81], [82], and although no single threshold is likely to suit all species, error can be minimised across a dataset for different threshold values. We tested a range of threshold percent values for their effect on both the false positive () and false negative () error rates. Categorisation of these error rates follows Meyer and Paulay [82]: “False positives are the identification of spurious novel taxa (splitting) within a species whose intraspecific variation extends deeper than the threshold value; false negatives are inaccurate identification (lumping) within a cluster of taxa whose interspecific divergences are shallower than the proposed value” (p. 2230). The optimum threshold is found where cumulative errors are minimised. Positive identifications were recorded when only conspecific matches were delivered within the threshold percent of the query. False negative identifications occurred when more than one species was recorded within the threshold, and a false positive was returned when there were no matches within the threshold value although conspecific species were available in the dataset. We incorporated a modification of the Bold and BCM analyses, using the revised threshold values generated during this procedure.\n        To evaluate the performance of the COI barcodes in terms of their agreement with nuclear RHO, a subset () of individuals were amplified for this marker. This yielded reduced datasets of 82 species (1–10 individuals per species) for which both the COI and RHO sequences were available. Barbs (Puntius) and danios (Danionini) were targeted, along with other taxa showing COI divergences. Patterns in the matched RHO and COI subsets were investigated using the NJ monophyly and k-NN methods. When a sufficient number of specimens were available () for aquarium species showing multiple COI clusters, we were able to explore this possibly unrecognised diversity with RHO, and assess an approach complementary to COI barcoding. We used four methods in assessing support for unrecognised or cryptic species: mean intergroup K2P distances; a character based approach using diagnostic, fixed character states between lineages, i.e., pure, simple “characteristic attributes” (CAs) [29], [83]; bootstrap estimates of NJ clade support (settings as described above); and Rosenberg's P, a statistical measure testing the probability of reciprocal monophyly over random branching processes [84].\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102361/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028381/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028381/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028381/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090023","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Objective: Expression of the viral E6/E7 oncogenes of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) is necessary for malignant conversion and maintenance in cervical tissue. In order to determine whether HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing more effectively predicts precancerous lesions and invasive cervical cancer than HR-HPV DNA testing, we aimed to compare triage using HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing by APTIMA HPV Assay (APTIMA) to HPV16 DNA testing, HPV16/18 DNA testing, and repeat cytology. Methods: Liquid-based (PreservCyt) cell samples were obtained from HR-HPV-positive women diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) within the framework of the population-based cervical cancer screening program in Stockholm, Sweden. Samples were tested for HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA by APTIMA (Gene-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Women were followed up for 4 years after the index cytology via medical and laboratory records, and the Stockholm Oncology Center. Results: Nine of 25 (36%) women in the ASCUS group, and 64 of 180 (36%) women in the LSIL group developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse during 4 years of follow-up. 162 (74%) women were APTIMA-positive, and APTIMA had the highest sensitivity to predict CIN2 or worse and CIN3 or worse in the ASCUS (77.8% and 100%) and LSIL (78.1 and 75.8%) groups, although specificity was insufficient (<50%). HPV16 DNA testing and repeat cytology were more specific than APTIMA. Conclusion: The results of this population-based study with comprehensive follow-up support the use of APTIMA as a triage test for women with ASCUS. More focused investigation is required for women with LSIL.

Researchers have primarily concentrated on identifying the factors that influence residential property prices and how such mechanisms function. However, few studies have examined the potential factors that influence housing prices from a big data perspective. In this article, we use a big data perspective to determine the willingness of buyers to pay for various factors. The opinions and geographical preferences of individuals for places can be represented by visit frequencies given different motivations. Check-in data from the social media platform Sina Visitor System is used in this article. Here, we use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyse the spatial patterns of check-in spots (or places of interest, POIs) and employ the Getis-Ord Gi* method to identify the hot spots for different types of POIs in Shenzhen, China. New indexes are then proposed based on the hot-spot results as measured by check-in data to analyse the effects of these locations on housing prices. This modelling is performed using the hedonic price method (HPM) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method. The results show that the degree of clustering of POIs has a significant influence on housing values. Meanwhile, the GWR method has a better interpretive capacity than does the HPM because of the former method’s ability to capture spatial heterogeneity. This article integrates big social media data to expand the scope (new study content) and depth (study scale) of housing price research to an unprecedented degree.\n"],"title":"Spatial and Social Media Data Analytics of Housing Prices in Shenzhen, China","materials_and_methods":["\nCase study: Shenzhen\nShenzhen is one of the most important cities in South China, with a land area size of 1,996.85 million km2 and a population of 10.78 million (as of 2014). The city is composed of the districts of Luohu, Futian, Nanshan, Longgang, Bao’an, Yantai, Guangming, Longhua, Pingshan and Dapeng (Fig 1). Since China initiated reforms and the ‘opening-up’ process, Shenzhen has served as China’s window to the world. With increasing economic development, housing prices in Shenzhen have risen and have become the subject of increasing attention. Moreover, Jones Lang LaSalle named Shenzhen one of the world's most dynamic cities in 2016. Therefore, this city offers a good case study for exploring the influence of urban hot spots on housing prices because the levels of POI activity (measured with check-in data) change dramatically during the same period in which housing prices are increasing.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164553.g001\nFig 1\n\nThe geographical location of the case study city: Shenzhen.\n\n\n\n\nHousing price dataset\nWe choose Shenzhen as our case study and collect new housing transaction data from Shenzhen Research Centre for Digital City Engineering for 27,112 dwelling units (totalling 159 real-estate properties) from July to December 2015. The data for certain housing and real estate attributes are obtained from the SOFANG website using crawler technology [43]. These attributes include apartment area, floor level, number of bedrooms, number of washrooms, green space ratio and plot ratio. Other locational and neighbourhood attributes, such as accessibility to the central business district (the Citizen Centre, which is the landmark of Shenzhen’s CBD), subway stations, bus stations, schools and hospitals are calculated by GIS and based on a network analysis. To avoid potential biases, this study limits the types of properties studied to ordinary commercial housing; duplex apartments and cottages are excluded from the study. Because of the short time span described by the trading data, it is reasonable to ignore the influence of time on housing prices.\nPrior to the model estimation, the data are pre-processed (via data cleaning and collinear data processing) to discard abnormal values. We obtain 25,323 effective samples and then employ a collinearity inspection between variables. We identify 17 variables that influence housing prices and classify the variables into three types: structural variables, locational variables and neighbourhood variables.

Users can tweet check-in data using a GPS device (such as a smartphone or tablet) to record their location at a given time. Check-in data are geo-tagged information that includes the check-in time and social information. Members of the public use check-in data to record their daily lives; therefore, these data can be used to reflect the average person’s daily activities. We select check-in data recorded from the social media platform Sina Visitor System between July 2014 and June 2015. The data are primarily related to the various types of POIs, and user and positional data are the most important units of information. Considering the randomness of check-in behaviour, we pre-process the data to delete superfluous and invalid records, as well as misbehaving or fake users [45]. We filter the check-in data using the following critera (i) the location of a check-in is not in Shenzhen based on the geographical location; (ii) the name of the POI is not correct based on the text discriminant; (iii) we believe that users who have only one check-in record are not valid users and that their behaviours are accidental in a given time period(July 2014 and June 2015 in this article); (iiii) and based on the third criterion, we filter valid POIs that are signed by at least one valid user. Finally, we acquire 447,778 check-in records from 216,165 users and 22,670 POI. To ensure the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) [46], we do not identify the information of users. This article uses 13,268 CBF sites and 1,413 GRE sites identified by researching the locations and names of POIs based on the Code for Classification of Urban Land Use and the Planning Standards of Development Land [47]. The CBF includes commercial facilities, business facilities, entertainment and sports facilities, and public utility outlets, and the GRE consists primarily of parks, green belts and urban squares. POI types and aggregated information can be seen in Table 2.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164553.t002\nTable 2 POI types and aggregated information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nAbbreviation\nCounts\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nCommercial and business facilities\nCBF\n13,268\n59%\n\n\nIndustrial\nIND\n890\n3.93%\n\n\nTransport facilities\nTRA\n1,696\n7.48%\n\n\nResidence communities\nRES\n3,569\n15.74%\n\n\nGreen space\nGRE\n1,413\n6.23%\n\n\nAdministration and public services\nAPS\n1,834\n8.09%\n\n\nTotal\n\n22,670\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial hot-spot analysis method based on check-in data\nIn this section, we present our proposed method for using check-in data to detect hot spots. Each check-in record includes the user ID, time, coordinates (longitude and latitude), POI ID, and name and category of the venue. We use address-coding technology to locate records for our database and detect hot spots using the number of check-ins, which are obtained from POI data [48]. The POI data include the POI ID, coordinates, check-in totals, user counts and categories. We measure the hot spots by identifying their relationship with different types of POIs and exploring the effects of CBF and GRE.\nBefore detecting the hot-spot status of the different types of POIs, we analyse the overall spatial patterns. The kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to analyse the spatial distribution of all check-in POI data. KDE attempts to produce a smooth density surface of spatial point events in geographic space [49]. The general form of a kernel density estimator is given by\n\n\n\n\nf(s)=∑i=1n1πh2k(dish)\n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f(s) is the KDE function at location s, h is the bandwidth of the KDE, dis, is the distance from point i to location s, and the function k (called the kernel function) represents the spatial weight function of the ratio between dis and the bandwidth h. Briefly, the results of the KDE rely on kernel sizes (called the search radius) and grid sizes. In this analysis, first, individual output cells were partitioned in 100m*100m areas, which can provide greater precision in the estimation most efficiently. Because too small of a grid size can increase the computational cost, whereas too large of a size can result in important details being ignored. Second, we select a search radius of 1000 m based on multiple testing rounds. Thresholds of less than 1000m, such as 600m and 800m, make the density distribution focus on a limited extent of elemental points, and the overall characteristic are not obvious. Conversely, thresholds of greater 1000m, such as 1200m and 1500m, make the density distribution overly smooth, and local differences cannot be well represented. We set 1000 m as the ideal threshold because it is the longest distance that remains comfortable to travel on foot (10–15 minutes) and obtains relatively good results in this paper.\nAfter kernel density analysis, we rank the POIs based on the counts of check-ins and users for all check-in spots to detect the POIs that are popular. The power-law distribution patterns (Fig 2) show that there are far more POIs with fewer check-ins and users than POIs with many check-ins and users. The patterns are similar to those in a previous study [33]. The results of Fig 2 suggest that POIs with high popularity, represented by the numbers of check-ins and users, provide more attractions to residents and are better known to people. Differences in peoples’ preferences and usages for POIs reveal that the formation of hot spots and cold spots for POIs is reasonable. We apply the ‘average nearest neighbour’ index to judge whether the spatial distribution of points is clustered or dispersed. This process is conducted for GRE and CBF separately. The clustering patterns of GRE and CBF are used to determine whether they are hot spots.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164553.g002\nFig 2\n\nThe power-law distribution patterns of check-ins (a) and users (b).\n\n\n\nBecause of the discrete distribution of points and simplification of the amount of big data [50, 51], we use grids to replace points to analyse the spatial patterns [52]. First, we divide the study area into 500 m x 500 m spaces and then apply the grid. Testing determined that 500 m is the optimal choice because a grid size larger than 500 m tends to mask local differences and because a grid size smaller than 500 m can exaggerate local characteristics. We then calculate the total number of check-in records and the number of POIs for each grid. We explore the possible hot spots using the grids and then use Getis-Ord Gi* to identify the hot spots. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistical clustering method [53, 54] is used to detect significant clusters of high value within a city according to locations that contain many people. Getis-Ord Gi* is a local statistic used to assess each feature within the context of neighboring features. This article defines a ‘hot spot’ as a place with a high degree of activity. The statistics are calculated as follows:\nEq 2 for a feature i:\n\n\n\n\nGi*=∑i=1nwijxi−X¯∑i=1nwijS[n∑i=1nwij2−(∑i=1nwij)2]n−1\n\n\n(2)\n\nwhere xi represents the attribute value of j, wij represents the spatial weight of j and i, and n represents the total number of features.X¯ and S are calculated according to Eqs 3 and 4, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nX¯=∑inxin\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nS=∑i=1nxi2n−(X¯)2\n\n\n(4)\n\nUsing these equations, we can obtain the z-score for each grid. For positive z-scores that are statistically significant, a larger z-score indicates a more intense clustering of high values (which identifies a hot spot) and vice versa. It is necessary to choose a method for conceptualising the spatial relations prior to the hot spot analysis. This article compares the results of various methods such as the inverse distance, fixed-distance band, Delaunay triangulation and space-time window methods. We select the fixed-distance band method to conceptualize the spatial relations because it is a good option for polygonal features. An appropriate value for the fixed-distance threshold is vital. This article applies incremental spatial autocorrelation to obtain z-score peaks that reflect the distances that correspond to the most pronounced spatial clustering processes [55]. Fig 3 uses Futian, Shenzhen as an example to illustrate the process in detail.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164553.g003\nFig 3\n\nSpatial hot-spot analysis model based on check-in data.\n\n\n\n\nGeographically weighted regression\nGWR was introduced by Fotheringham [6] and is an extension of HPM, which is based on ordinary least squares (OLS) [4]. The essence of the HPM is a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The attribute coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage change in housing prices for the semi-logarithmic function [56]. GWR is a spatial regression technique that takes spatial non-stationarity into consideration and allows local parameters to be estimated. The model is expressed as Eq 5:\n\n\n\n\ny=β0(ui,vi)+∑kβk(ui,vi)Xik+εi     i=1,……,n\n\n\n(5)\n\nwhere (ui, vi) represents the coordinates (longitude, latitude) of observation i, β0(ui, vi) represents the intercept value, βk(ui, vi) represents the estimated parameter for the kth variable of observation i and varies for different locations, and εi represents the error term. The GWR method is superior to the HPM because of its ability to capture spatial heterogeneity. The parameter βk(ui, vi) is estimated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nβ^(ui,vi)=(XTW(ui,vi)X)−1XTW(ui,vi)Y\n\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the weighting matrix is a diagonal matrix and the off-diagonal elements are all zero. Namely, W(ui, vi) = dia(Wi1, Wi2 … … Wij … … Win). The geographical weightings of observation i and observation j are represented by Wij. In this study, we obtain weighting matrixes for all the observations by using a fixed Gaussian kernel function: Wij=exp(dij2/h2). In addition,dij=(ui−uj)2+(vi−vj)2 is the Euclidean distance between i and j, and h is a non-negative parameter (bandwidth) that represents the decay degree with distance. An appropriate bandwidth can be selected based on the minimum Akaike information criterion for the GWR model (AICc) [57].\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152145/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152145/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152145/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152145/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164553/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164553/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164553/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Malformations of the cardiovascular system are the most common type of birth defect in humans, frequently affecting the formation of valves and septa. During heart valve and septa formation, cells from the atrio-ventricular canal (AVC) and outflow tract (OFT) regions of the heart undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and invade the underlying extracellular matrix to give rise to endocardial cushions. Subsequent maturation of newly formed mesenchyme cells leads to thin stress-resistant leaflets. TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in newly formed mesenchyme cells of the AVC and OFT that has been shown to play roles in cell survival, cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the downstream targets of TWIST1 during heart valve formation remain unclear. To identify genes important for heart valve development downstream of TWIST1, we performed global gene expression profiling of AVC, OFT, atria and ventricles of the embryonic day 10.5 mouse heart by tag-sequencing (Tag-seq). Using this resource we identified a novel set of 939 genes, including 123 regulators of transcription, enriched in the valve forming regions of the heart. We compared these genes to a Tag-seq library from the Twist1 null developing valves revealing significant gene expression changes. These changes were consistent with a role of TWIST1 in controlling differentiation of mesenchymal cells following their transformation from endothelium in the mouse. To study the role of TWIST1 at the DNA level we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and identified novel direct targets of TWIST1 in the developing heart valves. Our findings support a role for TWIST1 in the differentiation of AVC mesenchyme post-EMT in the mouse, and suggest that TWIST1 can exert its function by direct DNA binding to activate valve specific gene expression.\n      "],"title":"Twist1 Transcriptional Targets in the Developing Atrio-Ventricular Canal of the Mouse","materials_and_methods":["\n        Ethics Statement\n        All mice procedures were performed at the animal facility of the British Columbia Cancer Agency according to protocols approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and following Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.\n      \n        Tissue Collection\n        E10.5 embryos (Theiler stage 17) were collected from timed-matings of C57BL/6J females and the hearts were manually dissected using 30½G needles to separate the various regions of the heart. Blood was removed by puncturing the heart chambers and washing the tissue with PBS. All tissue was collected in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Images of dissected heart regions can be found in Figure S1. Tissue from 20 embryos was collected for the atria and ventricle libraries while tissue from 25 embryos was collected for the AVC and OFT. 8 AVCs were collected from Twist1 null AVC. Tissue for each region was pooled to avoid possible bias due to individual variation and to obtain at least 400 ng of total RNA for Tag-seq library construction. After isolation, RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Twist1 null mice have been described previously [25] and were maintained on an ICR (Taconic Farms) background.\n      \n        Gene Expression Analysis\n        Tag-seq libraries were constructed as described [27], using at least 400 ng of DNase I-treated total RNA. Briefly, after double-stranded cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) beads (Invitrogen), the cDNA was digested with an anchoring restriction enzyme (NlaIII) and ligated to an Illumina specific adapter (Adapter A) containing a recognition site for the Type IIS tagging enzyme MmeI. Following MmeI (New England Biolabs) digestion, which cuts 20-bp from the recognition site, a second Illumina adapter (Adapter B) that contains a 2-bp degenerate 3′ overhang was ligated. Tags flanked by both adapters were enriched by PCR, and the PCR products were run on a 12% PAGE gel, excised and purified. Cluster generation and sequencing was performed on the Illumina cluster station and analyzer (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. Raw sequences were extracted from the resulting image files using Bustard 1.8.28 and processed with ELAND (Illumina). Reads were assessed for quality using the Chastity filter (Illumina) with a threshold of 0.6. The tags were generated based on the first 21 bases of each read, which corresponds to the transcript-derived tag sequence. The first 4 bases are always the NlaIII site. The Tag-seq data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus [28] through the accession number GSE37746.\n        Tag-seq data was analyzed and mapped to genes using DiscoverySpace v4.0 [29]. Background tags, tags that could not be mapped to the genome, and those that contained 1-bp mismatch from tags generated from highly expressed genes were excluded. For all analysis, we selected tag-types with greater than 5 tags per library (tags with 5 or fewer counts in a library were considered not expressed) and used only unambiguous sense mappings based on the RefSeq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/). All tags representing a single gene were summed into an overall expression count to account for transcript variants. All tag counts were normalized to library size and values represented as tags per million. Differential expression analysis was done using the Bioconductor package edgeR [30]–[32] using the exact test in the package to calculate the fold changes and p-values based on a dispersion value of 0.12. Gene Ontology analysis was performed with DAVID [33], [34]. Enrichment was calculated against the whole RefSeq database as a background group and p-values were generated to represent one-tail Fisher Exact Test statistics.\n        Reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization was described previously [35]. Primers for qPCR and generation of in situ hybridization probes are found in Table S1. Periostin and Tbx20 probes were described previously [36], [37].\n      \n        Chromatin Immunoprecipitation\n        Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described [38] using either an anti-TWIST1 antibody (Abcam, ab50887, lot#772574) or a mouse non-specific IgG (Sigma, F2883) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) or qPCR (ChIP-qPCR). Briefly, whole heart or limb samples were homogenized and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes prior to the addition of glycine to 0.125 M. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and lysed for 15 minutes in ChIP cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40) followed by resuspension in ChIP nuclear lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.1). After 30 minutes on ice, cells were sonicated on ice-water (S3000 Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor Processor, Fisher) for 20 cycles of 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, chromatin was precleared with Protein A/G UltraLink Resin (20 µl, ThermoFisher 53135) in fresh ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167 mM NaCl, 16.7 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.1). Beads were spun down and removed and 3 µg of antibody was added to supernatants containing the sonicated DNA. All buffers contained protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Following overnight incubation at 4°C, samples were incubated with fresh Protein A/G beads for 4 h rotating at 4°C. The chromatin-bound beads were precipitated and washed in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl), high salt buffer (low salt buffer with 500 mM NaCl), lithium chloride buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.1) and twice with TE buffer. Antibody-chromatin complexes were eluted twice from the beads with 125 µl elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) each time. The collected samples were incubated with 1.0 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) and 2.5 µl RNaseA (10 mg/ml Invitrogen) overnight at 65°C to reverse cross-link. Chromatin was purified by phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 50 µl dH2O.\n        For ChIP-seq, DNA from three pooled ChIP samples (from 49, 107 and 85 whole hearts corresponding to 16.2 µg, 54.5 µg and 33.5 µg of chromatin respectively) was purified by SDS–PAGE to obtain 100–300 bp fragments for sequencing on Illumina 1G. Input DNA from the same E10.5 heart tissue was purified and sequenced for a control library. Sequences were mapped to NCBI Build 36 (mm9) reference mouse genome using Burrows-Wheeler-Aligner (BWA) v0.5.x [39]. Peaks were identified using FindPeaks 3.1 [40]. To identify TWIST1 binding sites, peaks were thresholded at a minimum peak height of 10 based on a false discovery rate of 0.01. To further limit false positives, for each peak that passed the FDR threshold, the coverage of the peak was compared to that of the control sample in the region +/−400 bp. Two criteria were set: the local z-score (calculated for each peak based on the peak height and the control coverage) had to be greater than 1.8, and the fold change between the TWIST1 peak and the control peak had to be greater than 1.75.\n        For ChIP-qPCR, the fold enrichment of each target site was calculated as 2 to the power of the cycle threshold (cT) difference between the IgG immunoprecipitated sample and the TWIST1 immunoprecipitated sample. Primers used for ChIP-qPCR are listed in Table S1.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040815/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nWe studied species diversity and genetic variation among populations of Brevipalpus mites from four species of citrus host plants.

Tanaka) Tanaka). Sample collections were made in the municipalities of Culiacan and Guasave in Sinaloa, Mugica in Michoacan, Montemorelos in Nuevo León, Oxkutzcab in Yucatan and Martinez de la Torre in Veracruz. The locations were selected because they all had orchards containing the four citrus species under evaluation, except Veracruz where no grapefruit could be found. The study was conducted in private orchards with the permission of the landowners. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.\nThe sampling methodology was similar for all citrus species. Mites were collected from both fruits and leaves from five trees with evident signs of mite feeding damage. In the field, and with the aid of a stereomicroscope, only the female adults of Brevipalpus species were collected for transportation to the laboratory. These female mites were inoculated on to fruits of the same species from the same orchard that had been prepared as described below. Each fruit was washed with soapy water, rinsed and allowed to dry for 12 hours. Half of each fruit was immersed in liquid wax which was allowed to solidify, and a thin line (approx. 2 mm width) of insect barrier glue (Agralan Ltd, Ashton Keynes. Wiltshire, UK) was placed around each orange, separating the wax-covered half from the clean half. Three lines (3 cm long × 2 mm width) made from a mixture of sand, flour and plaster in equal proportions were placed on the clean half of each orange (without wax) to provide refuges and oviposition sites for the mites. Approximately 10–50 adult female mites were collected and introduced on to each fruit. Once the mites had been introduced, each prepared fruit was then placed inside a plastic container (13 x 12 x 8 cm) on a layer of expanded polystyrene foam (2 cm thick). The wax-covered section of the fruit was embedded in the polystyrene layer to prevent the fruit from moving inside the container during transportation to the laboratory. Twenty-five fruits were prepared for each citrus × location combination resulting in a total of 575 fruits. No grapefruit could be found in Veracruz.\nIn the laboratory, one adult female was randomly selected from each fruit and placed on to a different fruit of the same citrus species that had been prepared as described previously. All fruits, each bearing a single female adult mite, were placed individually inside plastic containers and incubated at 25 ± 2°C, 60% RH and 12:12 light: dark regime. Fruits were replaced when necessary if dehydration was evident. Fruits were maintained under these conditions until the first generation of adult mites had developed.\n\nSpecies diversity and analysis of the effect of host plant species on the genetic population structure of Brevipalpus species\n\nDNA extraction and PCR protocols\nGenomic DNA was extracted from two first-generation adult mites per fruit, each representing an experimental sample. For this, the DNeasy Blood & Tissue (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) kit was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. A fragment of the gene COI was amplified using the primers DNF (TGA TTT TTT GGT CAC CCA GAA G) and DNR (TAC AGC TCC TAT AGA TAA AAC) [24]. PCR reactions were done in a 25 μL reaction volume containing 2.5 μL of buffer 10X (600 mM Tris-SO4 (pH 8.9), 180 mM ammonium sulphate), 1 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM of dNTP’s, 0.5 μL of Taq DNA polymerase (Quiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and 5 μL (approx. 20 ng) of DNA. PCR amplifications were done using a MyCycler (BIO-RAD Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Thermal conditions used were as follows: one cycle of 4 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 54°C and 60 s at 72°C with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels in 1X TAE. GelPilot 100 bp Plus (QIAGEN, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) size markers were used. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.1 μg mL–1) and photographed. All PCR products were sent to the company Macrogen Inc. (South Korea) for direct sequencing.\n\n\nData analysis\nSequence traces were edited and assembled using BioEdit v.7.1.9 [25]. Multiple alignments were made using Clustal W [26] implemented in BioEdit using the default alignment parameters set in the program. All sequences were analysed using maximum likelihood in Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) ver. 6.0 for Windows, with the Close-Neighbour-Interchange algorithm [27]. The robustness of branches was estimated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 repeated samplings of the data [28]. Tree reconstruction was made excluding non-synonymous substitutions, without any effect on tree topology. We show the tree including all sites. For the taxonomic placement of the samples, additional sequences from different Brevipalpus species were retrieved from GenBank. The sequence from Cenopalpus pulcher (Canestrini and Fanzago) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) was retrieved from GenBank and used as the outgroup for this analysis. In addition, the Nei-Gojobori method [29], as implemented in the Z test in the program MEGA 6.0 [27], was used to compute the synonymous and nonsynonymous distances at a 5% significance level.\nGenetic differences amongst haplotypes within each Brevipalpus species sampled were detected in a maximum parsimony network [30] using TCS v. 1.21 [31]. The connection limit amongst haplotypes (limits of parsimony) was set to the default value of 95%, and where gaps were treated as a 5th state. For the following analyses, only the samples from B. yothersi, the most abundant species after the phylogenetic analysis (see results section), were used. The partition of genetic variation amongst host citrus species populations and amongst populations from different geographical origins were analysed separately, and each analysis was followed by a comparison amongst all populations by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), estimated by computing F-statistics using Arlequin v. 3.5 [32] with 10000 permutations. In addition, the Mantel test was conducted to assess the correlation between genetic and geographic distances using the Isolation by Distance (IBD) web service [33].\n\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164552/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040814","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        The contractile system of nonmuscle cells consists of interconnected actomyosin networks and bundles anchored to focal adhesions. The initiation of the contractile system assembly is poorly understood structurally and mechanistically, whereas system’s maturation heavily depends on nonmuscle myosin II (NMII). Using platinum replica electron microscopy in combination with fluorescence microscopy, we characterized the structural mechanisms of the contractile system assembly and roles of NMII at early stages of this process. We show that inhibition of NMII by a specific inhibitor, blebbistatin, in addition to known effects, such as disassembly of stress fibers and mature focal adhesions, also causes transformation of lamellipodia into unattached ruffles, loss of immature focal complexes, loss of cytoskeleton-associated NMII filaments and peripheral accumulation of activated, but unpolymerized NMII. After blebbistatin washout, assembly of the contractile system begins with quick and coordinated recovery of lamellipodia and focal complexes that occurs before reappearance of NMII bipolar filaments. The initial formation of focal complexes and subsequent assembly of NMII filaments preferentially occurred in association with filopodial bundles and concave actin bundles formed by filopodial roots at the lamellipodial base. Over time, accumulating NMII filaments help to transform the precursor structures, focal complexes and associated thin bundles, into stress fibers and mature focal adhesions. However, semi-sarcomeric organization of stress fibers develops at much slower rate. Together, our data suggest that activation of NMII motor activity by light chain phosphorylation occurs at the cell edge and is uncoupled from NMII assembly into bipolar filaments. We propose that activated, but unpolymerized NMII initiates focal complexes, thus providing traction for lamellipodial protrusion. Subsequently, the mechanical resistance of focal complexes activates a load-dependent mechanism of NMII polymerization in association with attached bundles, leading to assembly of stress fibers and maturation of focal adhesions.\n      "],"title":"Functions of Nonmuscle Myosin II in Assembly of the Cellular Contractile System","materials_and_methods":["\n        Reagents and Constructs\n        Working concentrations of (−)- and (+)-Blebbistatin (Toronto Research Chemical Inc.) were prepared from 10 mM stock in DMSO. Latrunculin A (Calbiochem) was prepared from 2 mM stock solution in DMSO. Fluorescently labeled phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal α-actinin (Cytoskeleton), mouse monoclonal vinculin (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal NMII from bovine spleen [88], rabbit polyclonal mono- (Ser19) or double- (Thr18/Ser19) phosphorylated MRLC (Cell Signaling Technology, a gift from Dr. C.

All other reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.\n      \n        Cell Culture and Light Microscopy\n        REF52 rat embryo fibroblasts [18] were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37°C and 5% CO2. For blebbistatin treatment, cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to spread for 30 min; then blebbistatin was added and cells were cultured for additional 2 hours. For washout experiments, after 2 h incubation with blebbistatin, cells were transferred to fresh blebbistatin-free medium, incubated for various periods of time, and fixed.\n        For fluorescence staining, cells were quickly rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS either directly or after pre-extraction with 1% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA) optionally containing 2% polyethelene glycol (PEG) (MW 35,000) and 2 µM phalloidin. Directly fixed samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before staining. For costaining of F-actin, labeled phalloidin was added to the secondary antibody solution. Light microscopy was performed using Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with Plan Apo 100×1.3 NA objective and Cascade 512B CCD camera (Photometrics) driven by Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices).\n        For time lapse video microscopy, cells were cotransfected with mCherry-actin and GFP-MRLC using Lipofectamine LTX supplemented with PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were plated onto 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes in phenol red–free L-15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. Dishes were immobilized on the microscope stage to prevent movements during subsequent medium exchanges, and kept at 34°C during cell spreading and observation. An expressing cell was found after 1.5–2 hours of spreading, single images were acquired in DIC, red, and green channels and the medium was exchanged to one containing 100 µM blebbistatin. After 1 h incubation in dark, the blebbistatin-containing medium was replaced with normal medium after double wash, and time lapse imaging was started within 1 min after wash using Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) with Plan Apo 100×1.4NA objective and Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) driven by NIS-Elements AR software (Laboratory Imaging, Czech Republic).\n        Quantification of protrusions was performed on phalloidin-stained cells. Lamellipodia and ruffles were identified by their peripheral localization and increased fluorescence relative to the adjacent lamella (∼ 20–30% increase for lamellipodia and >30% increase for ruffles). The lengths of lamellipodia or ruffle-containing segments of the cell perimeter were measured using ImageJ software and expressed as percentage of the cell perimeter for each individual cell). At least 30 cells were used per condition.\n        For quantification of the cytoskeleton-associated fraction of NMII, the total fluorescence intensity of NMII immunostaining in detergent-extracted cells was measured after background subtraction using Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices). The data were expressed as percentage of fluorescence intensity of control untreated cells from the same experiment. At least 25 cells were used per condition. The pp-MRLC fluorescence intensity profiles along the ∼9 nm lines drawn from the cell periphery toward the center were obtained from immunostained cells using the linescan tool in Metamorph. At least 30 linescans from 10 cells were used per condition. Microsoft Excel software was used for statistics and plot generation.\n      \n        Electron Microscopy\n        Samples for platinum replica EM, correlative light and EM, gelsolin treatment, and NMII immunogold staining were processed as described previously [49], [91], [92], [93]. Extraction solution contained 1% Triton X-100, 2% PEG (MW 35,000), 2 µM unlabeled phalloidin, and 2 µM paclitaxel in PEM buffer. For determination of cell surface topography, the extraction step was omitted. Secondary antibody conjugated with 12 nm or 18 nm colloidal gold (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) were used for NMII immunostaining. For gelsolin treatment, detergent-extracted unfixed cells were incubated with 0.4 µg/ml gelsolin (gift of Dr. A. Weber, University of Pennsylvania). For immunogold NMII staining of gelsolin-treated samples, cells were incubated with the primary antibody in PEM buffer for 15 min after gelsolin treatment, rinsed in PEM and fixed.\n        Samples were analyzed using JEM 1011 transmission EM (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) operated at 100 kV. In experiments involving non-correlative EM, dozens of cells per sample were analyzed to evaluate the generality and variability of a phenotype. For experiments with correlative EM, the conclusions were derived based on analysis of 5–10 cells. Images were captured by ORIUS 832.10W CCD camera (Gatan, Warrendale, PA) and presented in inverted contrast. Identification of gold particles in replica EM samples was performed at high magnification after contrast enhancement to distinguish them from other bright objects in the samples, such as actin filament tips. Thus, gold particles showed up as solid white circles in contrast to actin filament ends, which usually have a donut-like appearance. Overlaid images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop by placing the fluorescence image as a separate layer in a screen mode on the top of the replica EM image. Gold particles were highlighted using brush tool in Adobe Photoshop with 50% opacity. Color labeling of other structures of interest was performed using Hue/Saturation tool in Adobe Photoshop to avoid obscuring the structural details.\n      \n        Gradient Centrifugation and Western Blotting\n        Cells were grown in 60 mm Petri dishes overnight in a regular medium and either left untreated or were treated for 2 h with 100 µM blebbistatin. Then, cells were incubated for 10 min on ice with 200 µl of lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.9), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton-X100, and 1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 3 (Sigma), and after incubation scraped off the dish into the same solution. The lysates were centrifuged at 68,000 rpm for 15 min in TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman) to remove detergent insoluble fraction. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using Bradford method and equalized for control and blebbistatin-treated samples. The lysates were overlaid onto a discontinuous gradient of OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma) in the lysis buffer consisting of 50%, 25%, 12%, and 6% layers. After centrifugation at 80,000 rpm for 60 min, 11 fractions (from top to bottom) were collected from each tube and mixed with the SDS-containing sample buffer (Invitrogen). All operations were carried out at 4°C. For Western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 3–8% gradient gels (Invitrogen) for staining with the heavy chain NMII antibody or using 12% gel for staining with pp-MRLC antibody.

We isolated human fat cells from subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue of female subjects and extracted histones from either purified nuclei or intact cells. Direct acid extraction of whole adipocytes was more efficient, yielding about 100 µg of protein with histone content of 60% –70% from 10 mL of fat cells. Differential proteolysis of the protein extracts by trypsin or ArgC-protease followed by nanoLC/MS/MS with alternating CID/ETD peptide sequencing identified 19 histone variants. Four variants were found at the protein level for the first time; particularly HIST2H4B was identified besides the only H4 isoform earlier known to be expressed in humans. Three of the found H2A potentially organize small nucleosomes in transcriptionally active chromatin, while two H2AFY variants inactivate X chromosome in female cells. HIST1H2BA and three of the identified H1 variants had earlier been described only as oocyte or testis specific histones. H2AFX and H2AFY revealed differential and variable N-terminal processing. Out of 78 histone modifications by acetylation/trimethylation, methylation, dimethylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, identified from six subjects, 68 were found for the first time. Only 23 of these modifications were detected in two or more subjects, while all the others were individual specific. The direct acid extraction of adipocytes allows for personal epigenetic analyses of human fat tissue, for profiling of histone modifications related to obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as for selection of individual medical treatments.\n      "],"title":"Histone Variants and Their Post-Translational Modifications in Primary Human Fat Cells","materials_and_methods":["\n        Isolation of human adipocytes\n        Samples of subcutaneous fat tissue were obtained during ordinary elective abdominal surgery on female patients at the University Hospital of Linköping. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee at Linköping University; all patients obtained written information and gave their informed verbal approval before the surgery, as approved by the ethics committee considering that the procedure posed no discomfort or threat to the health of the patients. Participating female subjects were 35–76 years old, with BMI ranging from 24.4 to 32.2 kg/m2 and no one of them was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The characteristics of participating subjects are given in the Table S1. Adipocytes were isolated from human tissue samples by collagenase (type 1, Worthington, NJ, USA) digestion in Krebs-Ringer solution essentially as described before [31]. At a final concentration of about 25% cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (GIBCO), containing 200 nM adenosine, 25 µM HEPES, 100 u/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, pH 7.4, at 37°C and 10% CO2 as previously described [32]. Following the overnight incubation, the cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer solution and incubated with 0.1 µM N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine and 2.5 µg/mL adenosine deaminase for 10 min before further treatment.\n      \n        Direct acid extraction of histones\n        Basic proteins from whole cells were extracted by acid. The cells were homogenized in 0.33 M H2SO4 with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 250 g, and removal of floating oil. The pellet was resuspended in the supernatant and incubated in a clean tube with slow rotation at 4°C for 2 h. Non-basic proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 60 min at 4°C and discarded. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant up to 25% and the samples were incubated on ice overnight. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 60 min at 4°C and washed 4 times with ice cold acetone with centrifugations at 16 000 g for 12 min at 4°C. Proteins were dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for protein determination by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Richmond, CA) using a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Finally the protein mixtures were dried, dissolved in 50 mM NH4HCO3 and dried again, which was repeated four times to remove residual acid.\n      \n        Extraction of histones from nuclei\n        To isolate nuclei, the cells were washed and homogenized in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na2-pyrophosphate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 4 mM iodoacetate, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 µM leupeptin, 1 µM pepstatin, 1 µM aprotinin and 0.1 mM PMSF. Nuclei were enriched and basic proteins extracted as previously described [21], [33]. Briefly the homogenized samples were layered on 0.8 M sucrose in 0.5% NP-40, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 2 700 g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 0.25 M sucrose in 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and then dissolved in 0.4 M H2SO4. After incubation in the sulfuric acid with slow rotation at 4°C for 2 h, proteins were treated the same way as described for whole cells above.\n      \n        Analysis of histone recovery after direct acid extraction\n        To control the recovery of histones we used immunoblotting of equal amounts of cell samples and of acid-extracted proteins, as calculated from the volumes of the starting material and of the final protein extract. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (14.5% acrylamide) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membrane (Immobilone-P, Millipore, MA, USA). The membrane was mounted in a SNAP i.d. system (Millipore, MA, USA), blocked with 0.5% BSA and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti “Histone 3 C-terminal” or “Histone H2B” antibodies (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with a secondary goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnical, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK) and chemiluminescence imaging (LAS 1000; Image Guage, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoblotting was repeated three times for extracts from each analyzed subject sample.\n      \n        Analysis of proteins by in-gel digestion and MS/MS\n        Acid-extracted proteins from whole cells or nuclei were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (14% or 12% acrylamide) and stained either with silver or with Coomassie Blue R-250 (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA). Stained gels were scanned and Photoshop Elements software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA) was used for intensity analysis. Protein bands were excised from the gels, reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 56°C, alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in darkness, and digested by trypsin for 4 h at 37°C essentially as described [34]. The extracted peptide mixtures were desalted on C18 reverse-phase ZipTips (Millipore) according to manufacturer's instructions. A 2 µL sample was loaded into a nanoelectrospray capillary and analyzed using API Q-STAR Pulsar I mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). CID of selected peptide ions was performed according to manufacturer's settings with manual control of collision energy. All spectra were analyzed manually as well as using MASCOT search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com/) against the NCBInr database.\n      \n        Analysis of all acid extracted proteins by microLC/MS/MS\n        The acid-extracted proteins were dissolved in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 1 µg/µL. For partial digestion with trypsin, 2.5% sequence-grade modified trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) was added and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 20°C. Digestion was terminated by addition of 5% formic acid. To digest the proteins with ArgC-protease, 1.25% ArgC (sequencing grade endoproteinase ArgC from Clostridium histolyticum, Roche) dissolved in 25 mM NH4HCO3 with 1 mM dithiothreitol was added and incubation was performed for 1 h, 4 h or 20 h at 37°C. Digestions were terminated by addition of 5% formic acid. The peptide mixtures were dried and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were analyzed by microLC/MS/MS using HCTultra PTM Discovery System (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). A 30×0.32 mm pre-column followed by a 150×0.3 mm column, both reverse phase C18 material with particle size 0.5 µm, were used for separation of the peptides at a flow rate of 7 µL/min in a gradient from 0.1% formic acid in water to 0.1% formic acid in 100% ACN. The separation gradient was distributed as follows: 0% B for the first 19 min; 0%–5% B in 19–20 min; 5% B for 20–31 min; 5%–40% B in 31–110 min; 40%–90% B in 120–130 min. An MS/MS method providing alternating CID and ETD fragmentation of the multiply charged ions was used. Peak lists were created from the raw data using Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Resulting MGF files were used for searches in NCBInr (20081116) on an in-house Mascot server (version 2.2.06) (www.matrixscience.com). Search parameters allowed data mass errors up to 0.7 Da for MS; for MS/MS data 0.6 Da for CID ions and 1.3 Da for ETD ions were used. The numbers of missed cleavages allowed were 3 and the charge states were varied. Modifications allowed were N-terminal acetylation (−89.03 Da), acetylation of lysine (+42.01 Da), monomethylation of lysine and arginine (+14.02 Da), dimethylation of lysine and arginine (+28.03 Da), ubiquitination of lysine (+114.04 Da), oxidation of methionine (+15.99 Da) and phosphorylation of serine and threonine (+79.97 Da) in several different combinations. Criteria for identification of a protein were as follows: at least two peptides in the protein identified by both CID and ETD or with a MASCOT score over 45, all spectra also had to pass manual validation.\n      \n        Histone analysis by nanoLC/MS/MS\n        For comparative analysis of histones from six different subjects the acid-extracted proteins were dissolved in 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 1 µg/µL and digested with trypsin for 4 h at 20°C or with ArgC-protease for 1 h, 4 h or 20 h at 37°C, as described above. The digestions were terminated by addition of 5% formic acid. The peptide mixtures were dried and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were analyzed by nanoLC/MS/MS using HCTultra PTM Discovery System (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). A 100 µm ×2 cm pre-column followed by a 3 µm; 75 µm ×10 cm column, both reverse phase C18 material, were used for separation of the peptides at a flow rate of 0.3 µL/min. The separation was performed in a gradient from 0.1% formic acid in water (A) to 0.1% formic acid in 100% ACN (B) as follows: 5%–20% B in the first 120 min; 20%–30% B in 120–150 min; 30%–100% B in 150–170 min; 100% B for 170–180 min. Two automated MS/MS methods were used to analyze each sample: one with alternating CID and ETD and the second performing only ETD with exclusion of 1+ and 2+ ions. The nanoLC/MS/MS analysis was implemented at least six times for samples from each of all six subjects in the study.\n        Peak lists were created from the raw data using Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and the resulting ETD.MGF files were used for searches in a small human histone database containing all proteins (5170 entries) found when searching the NCBI database for “Homo sapiens” [porgn:__txid9606] and H1, or H2A, or H2B, or H3 or H4 on an in-house Mascot server (version 2.2.06) (www.matrixscience.com). The peptide tolerance was set to ±0.7 and the MS/MS tolerance was ±1.3. The number of missed cleavages allowed was 1 for ArgC and 3 for trypsin and the charge states of the peptides were varied between 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ and 6+. Allowed variable modifications were: N-terminal acetylation (−89.03 Da), acetylation of lysine (+42.01 Da), monomethylation of lysine and arginine (+14.02 Da), dimethylation of lysine and arginine (+28.03 Da), ubiquitination of lysine (+114.04 Da) and phosphorylation of serine and threonine (+79.97 Da). To search all nine variable modifications in our big data sets against a database like NCBI or Swissprot an enormous data processing power is required. Thus, to overcome this problem we created the small “human histone” database. Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.0.00, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate the ETD based peptide identifications. All MASCOT-search files for one subject were loaded into scaffold and peptide identification criteria were as follow: the peptide had to be found in at least two separate LC/MS/MS experiments and pass a rigorous manual analysis validation. If peptides matched more than one member of a histone family the member with the highest coverage was reported.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Cell-free foetal haemoglobin (HbF) has been shown to play a role in the pathology of preeclampsia (PE). In the present study, we aimed to further characterize the harmful effects of extracellular free haemoglobin (Hb) on the placenta. In particular, we investigated whether cell-free Hb affects the release of placental syncytiotrophoblast vesicles (STBMs) and their micro-RNA content. Methods: The dual ex-vivo perfusion system was used to perfuse isolated cotyledons from human placenta, with medium alone (control) or supplemented with cell-free Hb. Perfusion medium from the maternal side of the placenta was collected at the end of all perfusion phases. The STBMs were isolated using ultra-centrifugation, at 10,000×g and 150,000×g (referred to as 10K and 150K STBMs). The STBMs were characterized using the nanoparticle tracking analysis, identification of surface markers and transmission electron microscopy. RNA was extracted and nine different micro-RNAs, related to hypoxia, PE and Hb synthesis, were selected for analysis by quantitative PCR. Results: All micro-RNAs investigated were present in the STBMs. Mir-517a, mir-141 and mir-517b were down regulated after Hb perfusion in the 10K STBMs. Furthermore, Hb was shown to be carried by the STBMs. Conclusion: This study showed that Hb perfusion can alter the micro-RNA content of released STBMs. Of particular interest is the alteration of two placenta specific micro-RNAs; mir-517a and mir-517b. We have also seen that STBMs may function as carriers of Hb into the maternal circulation.

Briefly, the perfusion experiment consisted of three perfusion phases lasting 120 minutes each, with medium exchange between the phases. Perfusion medium was supplemented with cell-free adult Hb (HbA) in the foetal circulation to mimic the PE condition, during phase II (3 mg/ml HbA, n = 6) and medium only in phase I and III. Control experiments were performed using medium alone for all phases (n = 6). The perfusate was collected from the maternal side at the end of all phases and used for isolation and analysis of STBMs.\n\nIsolation of STBMs from the perfusion medium\nThe STBM isolation was performed according to established protocols [46] from phase I and II. Thirty five ml of the maternal perfusate was centrifuged twice at 1500×g for 10 minutes in order to remove cellular debris. Ten ml of the supernatant was then further centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000×g at 4°C (pellet referred to as 10K STBM). The supernatant was ultra-centrifuged for 2 hours at 150,000×g at 4°C (pellet referred to as 150K STBM). The 10K and 150K STBM pellets were washed once with 1xPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and re-suspended in 150 µl and 50 µl PBS respectively, aliquoted and stored at −80°C.\n\nCharacterization of STBMs in the perfusion medium\n\nProtein concentration of STBMs\nThe STBM protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop technologies, Wilmington, USA).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) of STBMs\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed in two sets of preparations, first with antibodies against the human proteins tissue factor (TF), CD 63 and hsa-mir-222, a micro-RNA Assay primer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), labelled with colloidal gold (30, 15 and 5 nm in diameter, BBI International) as previously described [47]. In the second preparation, antibodies against the human adult Hb (HbA) protein was labelled with colloidal gold. The STBMs from both the 10K and 150K fraction were mixed with gold-labelled conjugates for 20 minutes at room temperature and then processed for negative staining, as previously described [48]. It is known that vesicles are permeabilized during TEM preparation, allowing antibodies and probes to label targets both on the surface and inside the STBMs. TEM was carried out three times in different specimens for both control and Hb perfused STBMs.\n\nNanoparticle Tracking Analysis\nNanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was performed using the NanoSight NS500 instrument (NanoSight, Amesbury, UK)[49]. This instrument passes a focused 488 nm laser beam through a suspension of the particles of interest and collects the scattered light using conventional microscope optics aligned at 90° to the beam axis. An electron multiplying charge coupled device captures a video of the field of view at 30 frames per second. The NTA program identifies and tracks Brownian motion of each particle from frame to frame, thus enabling the calculation of the hydrodynamic diameter via the Stokes-Einstein equation.\nSamples analysed with NTA were from the different phase II STBM preparations; 10K control STBM preparations (n = 6), 10K Hb (n = 6), 150K control (n = 6) and 150K Hb (n = 6). The STBM preparations were diluted in sterile filtered PBS at 1∶500 or 1∶1000 prior to analysis, in order to give vesicle counts of 1.5–9.0×108/ml. The diluted sample was introduced into the sample chamber and ten 20-second videos were recorded (shutter speed of 600; camera gain of 250). Fresh sample was introduced automatically between each video recording to eliminate settling and reduce sampling error. The videos were processed using optimised instrument settings (detection threshold 10; blur automatic; and minimum particle size 100 nm).\n\nAnalysis of miRNA in STBMs\n\nRNA isolation\nSmall RNA was isolated from the10K and 150K STBMs using mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) according to manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the RNA extraction procedure consists of a step using Acid-Phenol:Chloroform, separating RNA in an upper organic phase from RNA and proteins which partitions in a lower aqueous phase. This prevents the Hb protein from being present in the RNA preparations and interacting in the subsequent PCR procedure. All RNA sample concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop technologies, Wilmington, USA). RNA quality and miRNA content was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, using the Small RNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA).\n\ncDNA synthesis and real-time quantitative PCR\nRNA was transcribed using TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). 10 ng RNA was used for the10K STBMs. For the 150K STBMs, 5 ng RNA was used because of a lower RNA yield. The following nine miRNAs were analysed using pre-designed TaqMan® MicroRNA assays (Applied Biosystems): homo sapiens-microRNA-517b (hsa-mir-517b), hsa-mir-518b, hsa-mir-222, hsa-mir-424, hsa-mir-210, hsa-mir-16, hsa-mir-141, hsa-mir-205, hsa-mir-517a, Rnu6b. Sequence for the hsa-mir-517b assay corresponds to ppy-mir-517b (pongo pygmaeus-microRNA, according to the miRNA database mirbase.org), which differs two nucleotides from the human hsa-mir-517b-3p.\nQuantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using standard protocol supplied by manufacturer for TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes as described above. Each reaction was run in duplicate. Negative controls with no template as well as no reverse transcriptase controls were included for every miRNA primer pair. Data were normalized to Rnu6b, commonly used in miRNA PCR procedures. The fold-change values were calculated by normalizing against control samples from control perfused placentas placentas.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed using Origin 9 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA, USA).

The phytase inhibition is dose dependent and varies significantly between cereal species, between cultivars of barley and cultivars of wheat and between Fusarium graminearum infected and non-infected wheat grains. The highest endpoint level of phytase activity inhibition was 90%, observed with grain protein extracts (GPE) from F. graminearum infected wheat. Wheat GPE from grains infected with F. graminearum inhibits phytase activity significantly more than GPE from non-infected grains. For four barley cultivars studied, the IC50 value ranged from 0.978 ± 0.271 to 3.616 ± 0.087 mg×ml-1. For two non-infected wheat cultivars investigated, the IC50 values were varying from 2.478 ± 0.114 to 3.038 ± 0.097 mg×ml-1. The maize and rice cultivars tested gaveIC50 values on 0.983 ± 0.205 and 1.972 ± 0.019 mg×ml-1, respectively. After purifying the inhibitor from barley grains via Superdex G200, an approximately 30–35 kDa protein was identified. No clear trend for the mechanism of inhibition could be identified via Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk plots. However, testing of the purified phytase inhibitor together with the A. ficuum phytase and the specific protease inhibitors pepstatin A, E64, EDTA and PMSF revealed that pepstatin A repealed the phytase inhibition. This indicates that the observed inhibition of A. ficuum phytase by cereal grain extracts is caused by protease activity of the aspartic proteinase type.\n"],"title":"Aspergillus ficuum phytase activity is inhibited by cereal grain components","materials_and_methods":["\nPlant materials and reagents\nCultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. SJ8575204) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. ‘SJ111884’, ‘Matros’, ‘Invictus’ and ‘Agulatus’) were grown at Sejet Plant Breeding, Denmark. Commercial cultivars were included for maize (Zea mays cv. Delicata) and rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). F. graminearum infected and non-infected grains of a wheat cultivar (T. aestivum L., cv. ‘Skalmeje’) were kindly provided by Lise Nistrup, Department of Agroecology, Aarhus University. Reagents including A. ficuum phytase (Sigma P-9792) and sodium phytate (from rice; Sigma P-8810) were supplied by Sigma.\n\nPreparation of grain extracts for inhibition studies\nGrains were ground to a fine powder using a rotary mill (IKA® Tube mill control). Grain cell-free proteins were extracted in 1:10 (w/v) 25mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1mM CaCl2, by constant shaking (300–350 rpm) at 25°C for 1h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation (3392×g, for 30 minutes at 4°C) and used as grain protein extract (GPE) for the inhibition study.\n\nEnzyme inhibition assay\nPhytase activity and its inhibition was measured according to ammonium-molybdate method [18]. In brief, 100 μl of GPE (0–2 mg ml-1) was incubated with 10 μl (2.5 U ml-1) of A. ficuum phytase, 1 mM sodium phytate and 400 μl of 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1mM CaCl2, at 37°C for 1 hour. The reaction was terminated by adding 800 μl of stop solution (20mM ammonium heptamolybdate, 5mM ammonium vanadate and 6% nitric acid to the final concentration) to the reaction mixture. After centrifugation (4226×g, 5 min), the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 415 nm using 96 well plate reader (Epoch, BioTek, USA). The residual phytase activity under different GPE concentrations was determined relative to a blank sample.\n\nIC50 value and kinetics of phytase inhibition\nThe 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated from the dose–response curve obtained by plotting the percentage of phytase inhibition versus increasing concentrations of GPE (0–2 mg ml-1). Using the linear equation from the graphs, the IC50 values were determined taking the response (percentage of phytase inhibition) as 50%. The kinetic constants against A. ficuum phytase were determined by pre-incubating the enzyme in the presence of crude extract (1 mg ml-1) for 15 min at 25°C, followed by 45 min incubation at 37°C with increasing concentrations of sodium phytate substrate (0–2 mM). The activity of the enzyme was measured at four time points (0, 15, 30 and 45 min). The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) values were calculated by using Sigma Plot 11.0, Exploratory Enzyme Kinetics Module (Systat Software Inc., USA). The type of inhibition was determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. The kinetics of phytase inhibition was performed for the representatives of cereal species.\n\nGel filtration chromatography of inhibitors from barley\nProteins were fractionated from the GPE of barley cv. Invictus using an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) device equipped with a Superdex G200 (10/300 GL) column. The following protein standards were used for calibration of the column and estimating the apparent molecular weight of eluted fractions: 1) blue dextran (2000 kDa), 2) conalbumin (75 kDa), 3) ovalbumin (43 kDa), 4) carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), 5) ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) and 6) aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Protein standards were loaded and resolved separately into Superdex G 200 using isocratic elution in Buffer A (50 mM Na-acetate buffer pH 5.0 and 0.2 M NaCl). Briefly, proteins from GPE were precipitated using 60% ammonium sulphate at 4°C. The precipitate was re-suspended in 50 ml of 25 mM acetate buffer pH 4.5 and 1ml of resuspended pellet containing 20 mg ml-1 was loaded directly into the Superdex G 200. Proteins were eluted using an isocratic elution in Buffer A and ÄKTA FPLC specific Unicorn program. After 2 h of elution, each 2 ml fractions were collected and assayed for A. ficuum phytase inhibition.\n\nTreatment of FPLC fractions with protease inhibitors\nThe phytase inhibiting FPLC fractions were incubated with the following protease inhibitors at the indicated final concentration: 100 μM pepstatin A, 50 μM E-64, 5 μM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A mixture containing the 100 μl inhibitor fraction (1 mg ml-1), 10 μl A. ficuum phytase (2.5 Uml-1), 1mM sodium phytate and protease inhibitors, as stated above, were gently mixed and incubated in 400 μl of 25 mM acetate buffer pH 5.5 at 37°C for 1h. For blank samples, the inhibitors were substituted by an appropriate volume of 25 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5. The effect of pre-incubation on the activity of the inhibitor was studied for pepstatin A. In the pre-incubation experiments, FPLC fractions were incubated in 100 μM pepstatin A at room temperature for 1 h. A. ficuum phytase (2.5 Uml-1) and 1mM sodium phytate substrate were added to the pre-incubated mix and further incubated for 1 h at 37°C.

Thus, sensory stimuli must be processed ad hoc, i.e., independent—to a large extent—from the momentary brain state incidentally prevailing during stimulus occurrence. Accordingly, computational neuroscience strives to model the robust processing of stimuli in the presence of dynamical cortical states. A pivotal feature of ongoing brain activity is the regional predominance of EEG eigenrhythms, such as the occipital alpha or the pericentral mu rhythm, both peaking spectrally at 10 Hz. Here, we establish a novel generalized concept to measure event-related desynchronization (ERD), which allows one to model neural oscillatory dynamics also in the presence of dynamical cortical states. Specifically, we demonstrate that a somatosensory stimulus causes a stereotypic sequence of first an ERD and then an ensuing amplitude overshoot (event-related synchronization), which at a dynamical cortical state becomes evident only if the natural relaxation dynamics of unperturbed EEG rhythms is utilized as reference dynamics. Moreover, this computational approach also encompasses the more general notion of a “conditional ERD,” through which candidate explanatory variables can be scrutinized with regard to their possible impact on a particular oscillatory dynamics under study. Thus, the generalized ERD represents a powerful novel analysis tool for extending our understanding of inter-trial variability of evoked responses and therefore the robust processing of environmental stimuli.\nAuthor Summary: When Hans Berger described the human EEG in the 1920s, a pivotal finding was the demonstration of prominent oscillations in the frequency range between 8 and 12 Hz, which he called alpha wave rhythm. He also described for the first time the so-called “alpha blockade,” i.e., the suppression of the ongoing alpha activity when the subject opens his eyes. Based on these early findings, induced changes of macroscopic EEG oscillations have been reported for diverse physiological manipulations and processing of sensory information. The magnitude and the latency of these induced changes are, however, subject to variations, even if identical stimuli are processed. In order to enable investigations of the underlying neural mechanisms of these variations, we here establish a mathematical framework which allows one to scrutinize candidate explanatory factors with regard to their possible impact on the characteristics of the induced oscillatory dynamics. "],"title":"A Generalized Framework for Quantifying the Dynamics of EEG Event-Related Desynchronization","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics statement\nOne of the authors (SL), who had previous experiences with the acquisition of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) as a risk-free routine clinical procedure, served as volunteer subject for the proof-of-concept SEP recording.\n\nConventional ERD\nTo prepare for the introduction of the generalized ERD concept, we first present a brief outline of the conventional ERD measure. The standard measure of ERD quantifies a change in signal band power as difference between a baseline period prior to the event and an post-event period. Typically, the ERD is evaluated as the averaged response over a set of single trials. Up to now, two - basically similar - methods for estimating the ERD have been established, namely the power method [3] and the inter-trial variance method [27]. The advantage of the latter lies in the fact, that it compensates for the spectral bias which is introduced by phase-locked components. However, as the inter-trial variance method requires a slightly more complicated notation, but can be straightforwardly derived from the power method, we will for sake of simplicity introduce the conventional as well as the novel generalized ERD framework solely along the lines of the power method.\nIn order to attain a mathematical expression of the customary ERD, let  denote the instantaneous signal power in a narrow frequency band during the event-related period . Moreover, let  denote the averaged power in the reference period , that is(1)Denoting the expectation value, i.e., the average across trials, by , the traditional ERD at time  is defined as(2)By convention an ERD corresponds to a negative value, i.e., a decrease in power, while ERS refers to an increased signal power [3]. Note that the changes of the signal power are quantified only with respect to the deviation from the fixed, constant baseline level . The conventional view on ERD is illustrated in Fig. 1-A.\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000453.g001Figure 1\nComparision of conventional and generalized ERD.\nConventional ERD (panel A) measures the deviation of the event-related dynamics (blue solid line) from a constant baseline level (black dashed line) that is obtained as averaged power in the reference period . The generalized ERD (gERD), depicted in panel B, defines ERD/S in relation to a dynamic reference (black dashed) which is obtained from catch trials. The reddish and bluish areas of both panels indicate the resulting periods of ERD and ERS, respectively.\n\nGeneralized ERD\nWe start with the following consideration: if an unperturbed dynamics  is stationary it follows, that the expectation value  is a constant function and therefore independent of . Thus any point in time could be used to empirically estimate this constant value, just by averaging across trials (independent realizations of ). However, if the dynamics  is non-stationary, e.g., exhibits a deterministic negative trend, then the expectation value  is not necessarily constant and therefore depends on .\nConsequently, in order to quantify event-related changes of a non-stationary dynamics, an appropriate baseline should reflect the deterministic portion of the unperturbed non-stationarity dynamics. Hence, instead of using a fixed, static reference value, the generalized ERD measure uses the expected unperturbed dynamics as dynamic reference and therefore contrasts the expected dynamics of the instantaneous signal power between an unperturbed and an event-related condition. In order to get a reliable estimate of the expected unperturbed dynamics, we propose the use of so-called catch trials, which can be drawn from a continuous EEG measurement during time periods without the occurrence of the event under study (e.g., without somatosensory stimulus or a self-paced movements). This enables us to contrast event-related and reference dynamics directly. Therefore, we define the generalized ERD as the relative difference between both dynamics. Mathematically speaking, let  be a binary variable, that distinguishes between the two types of single trials, i.e., between catch  and event-related trials . Then we define the generalized ERD as(3)Here  and  denote the conditional expectation of the band power at time  for the event-related and the unperturbed condition, respectively. Complying with the notation of the conventional framework a desynchronization corresponds to negative values, i.e., a decrease in power, while an increase in signal power indicates an event-related synchronization (ERS).\nBy means of a customized example of somatosensory induced ERD/S Fig. 1 illustrates the two different notions of measuring ERD. In this example the ERD/S is induced at a non-stationary cortical state, that is characterized by a prominent negative drift in the signal band power (readily identifiable from the unperturbed dynamics in the right panel). Consequently, the conventional and the generalized ERD/S yield significantly different results. Most conspicuously, the conventionally measured ERS lasts for a much shorter period and its peak would also be reduced in magnitude. Moreover, relative to the static baseline, the event-related dynamics drops below this level for a second time subsequent to the ERS period. According to the conventional interpretation this would indicate a second ERD phase. However, the cause of this spurious second ERD can be directly attributed to the non-stationary cortical state at stimulus onset. In contrast, the generalized framework which directly compares against the dynamic reference, which captures the deterministic trend, can deal with this phenomenon and yields the familiar ERD-ERS complex.\nNote that if the unperturbed dynamics is stationary, then the expected reference dynamics  is a constant and is equal to the conventional baseline . Therefore the conventional and the generalized measure of ERD will coincide with each other in case of analyzing stationary dynamics. In this sense the proposed framework constitutes a generalization of the conventional ERD towards the analysis of spectral perturbations in the presence of dynamical cortical states. Accordingly, the difference between the two approaches only becomes evident when analyzing non-stationary dynamics. One particular field of application of the generalized ERD measure is the analysis of state conditional dependencies of ERD, where the conditional dynamics are not necessarily stationary.\n\nState conditional ERD\nTo enable investigations of the influence of arbitrary factors, such as the reaction time in a behavioral response paradigm or the magnitude of a particular EEG eigenrhythm, on the characteristic of the ERD (e.g., the ERD latency or magnitude), we incorporate an additional conditional variable into the ERD measures. To this end, let  be the explanatory variable representing the factor to be investigated, e.g., representing the level of cortical occipital alpha activity. The conditional gERD, given a particular state  (e.g., low, medium or high level of alpha activity), is defined as(4)In this formula the denominator and the enumerator represent the state conditional reference and event-related dynamics, respectively. Note, the state variable  is not necessarily limited to discrete values, such as low, medium and high alpha activity, but can also be continuous valued, e.g., representing the amplitude value itself. For computational aspects of estimating conditional gERD, however, we refer to the Supplementary Methods section in Text S1. Moreover, Matlab code is available at http://bbci.de/supplementary/conditionalERD/.\nRemark: The conventional ERD measure as given in Eqn 2 can be extended in an identical fashion by means of conditional expectations values.(5)However, in section “Results” will show that this simple extension of the standard measure yields spurious observations of ERD/S. For a detailed description of the empirical estimators of the state conditional ERD please refer to the Supplementary Methods section in Text S1.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nMarine mammals have greatly benefitted from a shift from resource exploitation towards conservation. Often lauded as symbols of conservation success, some marine mammal populations have shown remarkable recoveries after severe depletions. Others have remained at low abundance levels, continued to decline, or become extinct or extirpated. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of (1) publicly available population-level abundance data for marine mammals worldwide, (2) abundance trends and recovery status, and (3) historic population decline and recent recovery. We compiled 182 population abundance time series for 47 species and identified major data gaps. In order to compare across the largest possible set of time series with varying data quality, quantity and frequency, we considered an increase in population abundance as evidence of recovery. Using robust log-linear regression over three generations, we were able to classify abundance trends for 92 spatially non-overlapping populations as Significantly Increasing (42%), Significantly Decreasing (10%), Non-Significant Change (28%) and Unknown (20%). Our results were comparable to IUCN classifications for equivalent species. Among different groupings, pinnipeds and other marine mammals (sirenians, polar bears and otters) showed the highest proportion of recovering populations, likely benefiting from relatively fast life histories and nearshore habitats that provided visibility and protective management measures. Recovery was less frequent among cetaceans, but more common in coastal than offshore populations. For marine mammals with available historical abundance estimates (n = 47), larger historical population declines were associated with low or variable recent recoveries so far. Overall, our results show that many formerly depleted marine mammal populations are recovering. However, data-deficient populations and those with decreasing and non-significant trends require attention. In particular, increased study of populations with major data gaps, including offshore small cetaceans, cryptic species, and marine mammals in low latitudes and developing nations, is needed to better understand the status of marine mammal populations worldwide.\n"],"title":"Recovery Trends in Marine Mammal Populations","materials_and_methods":["\nData Compilation\nWe expanded a database of marine mammal abundance estimates collected by Kaschner (2004) [48] and Christensen (2006) [11]. We collected population-level abundance data from around the world from publicly available published journal articles, online government documents, stock assessment reports, and recovery plans. Major sources included: Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NMFS technical and administrative reports, U.S. Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports, St. Andrew’s Sea Mammal Research Unit reports, Australian and New Zealand government documents, International Whaling Commission documents, and numerous published primary sources (Table S1). We collected data up to 2008 or the next most recent data point. We also collected information on generation times, methods of data collection and abundance estimation, and data reliability. For abundance trend analysis, we limited our attention to time series with at least three estimates. Although a population is generally described as a group of interbreeding organisms of the same species in a defined area [49], for the purpose of this study we chose population abundance data according to consistently defined areas described in the source literature. Thus, we did not exclusively adhere to population or stock definitions from monitoring or regulatory agencies, but the population designations often matched.\nPopulation abundance data came from dedicated and opportunistic aerial, land-based and ship-based surveys, extrapolated total population or pup-count data, photo-identification and mark-recapture models, genetic diversity analysis, combined totals from the literature, models that relied heavily on bycatch, catch or catch-per-unit-effort data, various other model-derived estimates from these aforementioned types of data (including age- or stage-based, simple regression, Bayesian or state-space models), and in some cases unknown or unstated methods (Table S1). When year ranges were provided for abundance estimates, we used the mid-point of the range.\nError is present in virtually all marine mammal abundance data, but it may originate from different sources. For example, catch, bycatch, or product data could be subject to intentional or unintentional misreporting. In turn, abundance estimation from inaccurate data may provide faulty estimates of K or the intrinsic rate of increase (rmax), both of which may vary over time [6]. Historical abundance estimates from DNA have been questioned because of uncertainty over changes in mutation rates, appropriate designation of particular populations, and migration, all of which can affect population estimates [38]. Survey data are affected by biases such as avoidance or attraction behavior of the species surveyed, and estimates may also be skewed because of detectability issues, particularly for more cryptic species. Analysis methods have been developed, however, to correct survey data for unobserved animals that may be at sea or are otherwise not visible [45], [50], [51].\nWe collected any reported error information (e.g. coefficient of variation, confidence intervals, standard error, or standard deviation). Where available, we gathered pre-exploitation abundance estimates and K estimates. In cases where multiple historical estimates were found (e.g. catch vs. genetic data) we recorded them all. Not all data sources reported error, so we used a system to incorporate quantitative error information (where available) with qualitative information about the data source for each data point and its reliability into abundance trend estimation (Abundance Confidence ID (ACID), Text S1).\n\nData Analysis – Trend Overview\nWe used a general definition of recovering populations being those that displayed an increase in abundance. Our main objectives were to gather abundance data and statistical evidence so as to broadly classify populations as having either increasing or decreasing trends, rather than attempting to estimate and describe complex population trajectories. In order to do so we estimated a trend for each population over the three most recent generations. This corresponded with the criteria used by the IUCN for assessing population decline [42]. In cases where we did not have data for the entire three-generation time period, we used the available time period with a required minimum of ten years instead (i.e. the minimum time period used by the IUCN for assessing population declines [52]) (Table S2).\n\nTrend Analysis\nGiven available data and our aim, we used robust regression to estimate population trends. Robust regression is a powerful tool for fitting linear models that simultaneously identifies and down weights outlying data points [53], [54]. Specifically we used the lmRob command in the robust library in R (which makes available an S-estimator [55] with a high breakdown point). We performed a full exploratory analysis using simple and robust linear regression, as well as log-linear robust regression (i.e. with a log transformation of the abundance values) and with and without weighting to include abundance data error information. We fit simple and robust regressions to both regular abundance data (i.e. number of individuals) and standardized abundance data (obtained by subtracting the mean from each data point and dividing by the standard deviation). The standardization facilitated comparison of regression results amongst different populations. We decided to use robust linear and robust log-linear weighted regressions as they best reflected the data. The complete R code is available in Text S2.\nResults of fitting the linear and log-linear robust weighted regressions were then used to classify each population as Significantly Increasing, Significantly Decreasing, Non-Significant Change, or Unknown. To start, any populations with insufficient data (i.e. <3 data points over three generations or minimum 10 years) were deemed Unknown. Those remaining were classified according to both the direction and significance of their abundance trend. Specifically, Significantly Increasing and Significantly Decreasing populations had positive or negative slope estimates, respectively, and 95% confidence intervals that did not include zero. Populations with 95% confidence intervals that did include zero were classified as showing Non-Significant Change. Our classifications of population trends allowed for an easily interpretable summary of patterns in the marine mammal population abundance data.\n\nTrend Comparisons\nWe examined both the population trend estimates (and the ensuing classifications) for marine mammals overall, as well as for notable taxonomic divisions (cetaceans, pinnipeds, other marine mammals), main habitat type according to Jefferson et al. (2008) [5] (for cetaceans only: coastal, offshore, or both), and other relevant sub-groupings (e.g. mysticetes or baleen whales, odontocetes or toothed whales, a sub-group of just dolphins and porpoises, otariids or eared seals, phocids or true seals). The groupings were not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, a pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) population would be included in the overall marine mammal category, as well as the cetacean, odontocete, and dolphin and porpoise sub-groupings. The groupings for each population are included in Table S2. Many of the populations for which time series data exist overlapped spatially or were nested in each other’s range, thus likely representing a similar set of individual animals. To avoid such double counting, we grouped populations into the largest and smallest non-overlapping or non-nested areas and analyzed both sets separately. These groupings by large and small areas are also listed in Table S2.\n\nComparison with IUCN Data\nWe compared our population trend classifications (Significantly Increasing, Significantly Decreasing, Non-Significant Change, Unknown) to those available through the IUCN Red List (Increasing, Decreasing, Stable, Unknown) (www.iucnredlist.org, Table S3). Since our data were mostly collected at a population level, and the IUCN mostly works with species level, we first summarized our data at a species level to facilitate comparison. For each species, we selected from our database those populations that comprised the majority of the overall species abundance. In cases of multiple non-nested and approximately equal-sized populations, we took the most frequently occurring trend classification of the populations of the species. If this did not exist (e.g. as for three populations with different trend classifications), we listed the population classification for that particular species as Unknown.\n\nHistorical Declines and Recent Increases\nWith the available data, we also had the opportunity to examine another facet of marine mammal recovery. For some populations (n = 47), we had at least one historical estimate, as well as a minimum population estimate and a current population estimate that was above the minimum estimate. Thus, these populations demonstrated both a historical decline (decrease) and evidence of recent recovery (increase) (Table S4). We were interested in whether the magnitude of recent recovery was related to the magnitude of historical decline. Therefore, the historical abundance estimate(s) was compared to the population minimum and the most recent abundance estimates to estimate the magnitude of decline and the magnitude of recovery with respect to the historical population size. For the populations for which there existed multiple historical abundance estimates, we used the mean of the declines and recoveries relative to these historical estimates. In addition to the magnitude of recovery, we were also interested in comparing the magnitude of historical population declines to the rates of recovery (i.e. the slopes of our above regression analysis). Unfortunately, only a small subset of the populations with historical abundance estimates had enough data over three generations to derive a rate of recovery, which provided too small a sample size from which to derive meaningful patterns.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077908/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nDe novo lipogenesis and hypercaloric diets are thought to contribute to increased fat mass, particularly in abdominal fat depots. CB1 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, and CB1-mediated signalling is associated with stimulation of lipogenesis and diet-induced obesity, though its contribution to increasing fat deposition in adipose tissue is controversial. Lipogenesis is regulated by transcription factors such as liver X receptor (LXR), sterol-response element binding protein (SREBP) and carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP). We evaluated the role of CB1 in the gene expression of these factors and their target genes in relation to lipogenesis in the perirenal adipose tissue (PrAT) of rats fed a high-carbohydrate diet (HCHD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). Both obesity models showed an up-regulated gene expression of CB1 and Lxrα in this adipose pad. The Srebf-1 and ChREBP gene expressions were down-regulated in HFD but not in HCHD. The expression of their target genes encoding for lipogenic enzymes showed a decrease in diet-induced obesity and was particularly dramatic in HFD. In HCHD, CB1 blockade by AM251 reduced the Srebf-1 and ChREBP expression and totally abrogated the remnant gene expression of their target lipogenic enzymes. The phosphorylated form of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-p), which participates in the CB1-mediated signalling pathway, was markedly present in the PrAT of obese rats. ERK-p was drastically repressed by AM251 indicating that CB1 is actually functional in PrAT of obese animals, though its activation loses the ability to stimulate lipogenesis in PrAT of obese rats. Even so, the remnant expression levels of lipogenic transcription factors found in HCHD-fed rats are still dependent on CB1 activity. Hence, in HCHD-induced obesity, CB1 blockade may help to further potentiate the reduction of lipogenesis in PrAT by means of inducing down-regulation of the ChREBP and Srebf-1 gene expression, and consequently in the expression of lipogenic enzymes.\n"],"title":"CB1 Blockade Potentiates Down-Regulation of Lipogenic Gene Expression in Perirenal Adipose Tissue in High Carbohydrate Diet-Induced Obesity","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nAll experimental procedures with animals were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the European Communities directive 2010/63/EU and Spanish legislation (Real Decreto 53/2013, BOE 34/11370–11421, 2013) regulating the care and use of laboratory animals. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Málaga (Permit number: 2011/0001). Male Wistar rats (Charles Rivers, Barcelona, Spain) were housed in pairs in cages maintained in standardized conditions of animal facilities at 20±2°C room temperature, 40±5% relative humidity and a 12 h light/dark cycle with dawn/dusk effect. At the beginning of the experiments the rats weighed 200–250 g and were 10–12 weeks old. Water and food were available ad libitum throughout the course of the study. Animals were anaesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) in a room separate from the other experimental animals and sacrificed by decapitation. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.\n\nMeasurement of Body Weight Gain\nRats (n = 16 per group) were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks with three different types of diet: a regular chow diet (standard diet, STD) purchased from Harlam Teklad, Madison WI, a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat diet; D12492), or a high-carbohydrate diet (HCHD, 70% carbohydrate diet; D12450B) both purchased from Research Diets Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The HFD and HCHD were used in order to induce obesity. The STD contains 12.12 kJ/g (6% fat, 20% protein), the HFD diet consisted of 21.90 kJ/g (of which, 20% of the metabolizable energy content was protein, 20% carbohydrates and 60% fat) and the HCHD had 16.09 kJ/g (with 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates and 10% fat). The HFD contained fat constituted by soybean oil (9.26 kJ% of total fat content) and lard (90.74 kJ% of total fat content) while the HCHD contained carbohydrates constituted by corn starch (45 kcal% of total carbohydrate content), maltodextrin (5 kJ% of total carbohydrate content) and sucrose (50 kJ% of total carbohydrate content). The body weight gain was measured every two days for 12 weeks.\n\nSubchronic AM251 Treatment\nAfter 10 weeks (divergence of weight curves) half of each group of diet-fed rats (n = 8 per group) received a daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (1 mL/kg of 10% Tocrisolve in saline) or CB1 receptor inverse agonist AM251 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), at 3 mg/kg in 10% Tocrisolve, over 14 days, while the diets remained unchanged. The cumulative food/calorie intake and body weight gain were measured every day during the 14 days of treatment. Thus, we generated six experimental groups: STD-vehicle and STD-AM251, HFD-vehicle and HFD-AM251, and HCHD-vehicle and HCHD-AM251.\n\nSample Collection, Perirenal Adipose Tissue Extraction and Histological Examination\nFree-feeding animals from the six experimental groups were anaesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) two hours after the last dose of treatment in a room separate from the other experimental animals. Blood samples were collected from the orbital cavity into tubes containing EDTA-2Na (1 mg/mL blood) and centrifuged (1600 g for 10 min, 4°C), and all plasma samples were frozen at −80°C for biochemical analysis. Perirenal adipose tissue (PrAT) was dissected (16 animals per diet group), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80°C until mRNA or protein extraction for subsequent analysis. The PrAT collected from rats (16 animals per diet group) were also prepared for histological examination. Samples were cut into small pieces, immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, and embedded in paraffin. Then samples were cut by microtome (5-µm thick), mounted on D-polylysinated glass slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for the evaluation of adipocyte size, tissue structure and inflammatory state by using an optical microscope (Olympus).\n\nRNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis\nTotal RNA from PrAT sections (250 mg) was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified with Rneasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were determined using a Nanodrop TM spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific). RNA (1 µg) was reverse transcribed with Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).\n\nReal-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Gene Expression Analysis\nThe expression of genes encoding for rat CB1 (Cnr1), LXRα (Lxrα), SREBP (Srebf-1), ChREBP (ChREBP), ACCα (Acaca), FAS (Fasn), and SCD1 (Scd1) was measured by qPCR. As reference genes we used rat ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19) and rat Sp1 transcription factor (Sp1). Specificity for each primer was tested using BLAST analyses on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The gene symbol, GeneID, primer sequences, and amplicon length are listed in Table 1. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out on the CFX96 Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for each cDNA template and amplified in 15 µl reaction volume containing 1x SYBR Green PCR master mix (Rox; Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany, Roche), and the Forward (Fw) and Reverse (Re) primers mix. Each assay included, in duplicate, a no-template control (NTC, water) to verify no amplification of contamination. Thermocycling parameters were the same for each amplicon following the supplier’s instructions with one cycle at 95° for 10 min for initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of two-steps at 95° for 10 s and 60° for 30 s, ending with a melting curve. Specificity was assessed with melting curves.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090016.t001Table 1\nPrimer sequences used for real-time quantitative PCR.\n\n\n\n\nGene symbol\nGeneID\n\nPrimer sequence 5′ to 3′\nGeneBank AN*\nAmplicon length\n\n\n\n\nCnr1\n25248\nFw\nACAGCCAGCATGCACAGGGC\nNM_012784.3\n94\n\n\n\n\nRe\nCGGCGGACGTGTCTGTGGAC\n\n\n\n\nAcaca\n60581\nFw\nTGTGGGCTGGCTGGGGTCAT\nNM_022193.1\n104\n\n\n\n\nRe\nCGCCCACATGGCCTGACTCG\n\n\n\n\nFasn\n50671\nFw\nAGTTTCCGTGAGTCCATCCT\nNM_017332.1\n182\n\n\n\n\nRe\nTCAGGTTTCAGCCCCATAGA\n\n\n\n\nScd1\n246074\nFw\nGAAGCGAGCAACCGACAG\nNM_139192.1\n71\n\n\n\n\nRe\nGGTGGTCGTGTAGGAACTGG\n\n\n\n\nLxrα\n58852\nFw\nAGGGCTCCAGGAAGAGATGT\nNM_031627.2\n76\n\n\n\n\nRe\nCAACTCCGTTGCAGAGTCAG\n\n\n\n\nSrebf-1\n78968\nFw\nCGTGGATGGGGACTGGGCTGTA\nXM_001075680.2\n172\n\n\n\n\nRe\nCCTGTCTCCATCAGCTGCCCCT\n\n\n\n\nChREBP\n171078\nFw\nACAACCCCTGCCTTACACAG\nFN432819.1\n180\n\n\n\n\nRe\nGAGGTGGCCTAGGTGGTGTA\n\n\n\n\nReference genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRpl-19\n81767\nFw\nTGCCGGAAGAACACCTTG\nNM_031103.1\n121\n\n\n\n\nRe\nGCAGGATCCTCATCCTTCG\n\n\n\n\nSp1\n24790\nFw\nGCTATAGCAAACACCCCAGGT\nNM_012655.1\n115\n\n\n\n\nRe\nGATCAGGGCTGTTCTCTCCTT\n\n\n\n\n\n*Accesion number.Fw = Forward.Rev = Reverse.\nRaw fluorescence data were submitted to the online Miner tool (http://www.miner.ewindup.info/) for calculation of Cq and efficiency values for each experimental set [39]. Cq values were converted into relative expression values taking into account amplification efficiencies, inter-run variations, and normalization factors by means of Biogazelle’s qbase PLUS software (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) using both Rpl19 and Sp1 as reference genes [40]. Repeatability between replicates was accepted when the ΔCq value was <0.7. For all reference and target gene studies, two independent biological samples of each experimental condition were evaluated in technical duplicates. Finally, Calibrated Normalized Relative Quantity (CNRQ) values were exported from the qbasePLUS software and investigated statistically.\n\nProtein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis\nPrAT samples were disrupted in lysis buffer (0.2% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NaDOC, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6) supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Complete tablets). The suspension was shaken for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 45 min at 10°C, recovering the soluble fraction below the fat ring. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay. Protein extracts were diluted 1∶1 in 2X sample buffer containing DTT and boiled for 5 min before submitting to SDS-PAGE. Samples (50 µg of total proteins each) were resolved in gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad laboratories, Inc) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 200 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) with 2% BSA. Specific proteins were detected by incubation in TBS-T, 2% BSA for 2 h with the corresponding primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ACCαβ, anti-FAS, anti-SCD1, anti-PKA, anti-PKAαβ-Thr198, anti-AMPKα, anti-AMPKα-Thr172, anti-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 and anti-Actin antibodies, all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (MA, USA). Rabbit anti-LXRα was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and Anti-Adaptin γ antibody was from BD Biosciences (NJ, USA). After extensive washing in TBS-T, anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, MI, USA) was added for 1 h. Membranes were subjected to extensive washings in TBS-T and the specific protein bands were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminiscence detection system (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology Inc. CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and images were visualized in an Autochemi-UVP Bioimaging System. Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis performed by ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij, 1997–2012).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data for graphs and tables are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the computer program GraphPad Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The significance of the differences between groups was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni’s post hoc) or by one-tailed Student’s t test with the Welch correction applied when appropriate (no equal variances assumed) when comparing only two conditions. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*, # p<0.05; **, ## p<0.01; ***, ### p<0.001).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090016/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003703","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","abstract":["\nThe innate immune response to viruses is initiated when specialized cellular sensors recognize viral danger signals. Here we show that truncated forms of viral genomes that accumulate in infected cells potently trigger the sustained activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB and the production type I IFNs through a mechanism independent of IFN signaling. We demonstrate that these defective viral genomes (DVGs) are generated naturally during respiratory infections in vivo even in mice lacking the type I IFN receptor, and their appearance coincides with the production of cytokines during infections with Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza virus. Remarkably, the hallmark antiviral cytokine IFNβ is only expressed in lung epithelial cells containing DVGs, while cells within the lung that contain standard viral genomes alone do not express this cytokine. Together, our data indicate that DVGs generated during viral replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host immune response to infection.\nAuthor Summary: In infections with viruses well adapted to the host virus-encoded proteins that delay the cellular response allow the virus to replicate to high titers prior to host intervention. The mechanisms overcoming viral evasion of the immune system and leading to the production of the primary antiviral cytokine IFNβ are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that truncated forms of viral genomes that are generated in situ during virus replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host immune response to respiratory viral infections in vivo. Defective viral genomes (DVGs) are able to function as triggers of the immune response even in the absence of type I IFN signaling and are strong triggers of the host response to infection while overcoming viral antagonism.

The protocol (803176) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Pennsylvania Animal Welfare Assurance Number A3079-01.\n\nCell lines and mice\nTC-1 cells (mouse lung epithelial cells, ATCC, #DR-L2785), LLC-MK2 cells (monkey kidney cells, ATCC, #CCL7), MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, kindly provided by Dr. T. Moran, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (BSR-T7) (kindly provided by Dr. C. Basler, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), and WT and Ifnar1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. B. tenOever, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mL L-Glutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamicin. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Farms, Inc. IFNβ-YFP reporter mice (B6.129-Ifnb1tm1Lky/J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. Ifnar1−/− mice were a kind donation of Dr. Thomas Moran (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) and were bred in our animal facility.\n\nViruses\nSeV strains Cantell, 52, Enders, and Z, and influenza A/PR8/34 virus were grown in 10 days hen embryonated eggs (SPAFAS; Charles River Laboratories). SeV Cantell was passaged to retain its original high DI particle content (HD) or to deplete it of DI particles (LD) as we previously described [24]. In brief, SeV 52, Enders, Z, and Cantell HD were grown in embryonated hen eggs inoculated with 30,000 medium tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) for 40 h. SeV Cantell HD TCID50 was calculated by end point dilution in LLCMK2 cells in the presence of trypsin, as described below [24]. SeV Cantell HD total particles were calculated by end point dilution of hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells. SeV Cantell HD stocks had consistently an infectious:total particle ratio of 5,000–15,000. SeV 52 had an infectious:total particle ratio of 24,472. SeV Enders had an infectious:total particle ratio of 38,746. SeV Z had an infectious:total particle ratio of 391,553. SeV Cantell LD was prepared by inoculating embryonated hen eggs with 3 TCID50 for 40 h. Under these conditions only 33% of the eggs grew virus. Allantoic fluid from those eggs was pooled and diluted 1/106 for subsequent inoculation into embryonated hen eggs in a total volume of 100 µl. Allantoic fluid containing virus (80% of the inoculated eggs) was pooled and tittered as described below. SeV Cantell LD stocks had consistently an infectious:total particle ratio of 100,000–200,000. IAV strain PR8 (LD) was grown by inoculating hen embryonated eggs with 30,000 TCID50 obtained directly from infected lung homogenates. Allantoic fluid containing the virus was collected 40 h later. Egg's allantoic fluid was snap frozen in an ethanol/dry-ice bath and stored at −80°C. IAV PR8 containing high dose of DI particles (HD) was kindly provided by Dr. Laurence C. Eisenlohr, V.M.D., Ph.D (Thomas Jefferson University). IAV HD was grown by inoculating hen embryonated eggs with 10,000 pfu of egg-passed virus. Eggs were incubated at 35°C and allantoic fluid containing the virus was collected 48 h later. IAV PR8 HD and LD stocks were originated from the same parent stock but were extensively passaged in the different conditions described.\n\nVirus titrations\nPermissive cells were infected with serial 1∶10 dilutions of lung homogenates or virus stocks in the presence of 2 mg/ml of trypsin to determine the medium tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). LLCMK2 cells were used for SeV titration, while MDCK cells were used for IAV titration. After 72 h of incubation at 37°C, 50 µl of supernatant from each well was tested by hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells (RBCs) for the presence of virus particles at the end point dilution. To do this, 1∶4 dilutions of the cell supernatant were incubated in 0.5% chicken RBCs at 4°C for 30 min. Hemagglutination of RBCs indicated the presence of SeV or influenza virus particles.\n\nGeneration of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and infection\nBMDCs were generated as previously described [24]. Detailed procedure can be found in the Supplemental Information Material and Methods. BMDCs were infected after 4 days in culture with viruses at an multiplicity of 1.5 as we have previously described [24].\n\nMice infections\nFor SeV infections, mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (Avertin®; Acros Organics) and inoculated in the nostrils with 30 µl of PBS containing 104 or 105 TCID50 of SeV. For IAV infections animals were infected intranasally with 100 TCID50/mouse in a 30 µl volume. Lungs were extracted at different times post-infection, homogenized in 0.1% w/v Gelatin-PBS and snap frozen in dry-ice/ethanol for preservation.\n\nRNA extraction and PCR for viral genome detection\nTotal RNA was extracted from cell lines or lungs with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications and total RNA was reversed transcribed using the high capacity RNA to cDNA kit from Applied Biosystem. For sorted cells, 500 ng of RNA were reversed transcribed, for all other experiments 1–2 µg of RNA were reversed transcribed. cDNA was diluted to a concentration of 10 µg/µl and amplified with specific primers in the presence of SYBR green (Applied Biosystem). For the detection of DVGs, isolated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III without RNase H activity, to avoid self-priming by the DVGs complementary ends and recombinant RNase H (Invitrogen) was added later to the samples. For the detection of the standard virus genome, the negative strand of the full-length genome was reverse transcribed with Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche). PCR detection for IAV was performed using as it has been previously described [54]. Primers and detailed PCR conditions can be found in the Supplemental Information Material and Methods.\n\nRT-qPCR\nDetailed primers and PCR conditions can be seen in the Supplemental Information Material and Methods.\n\nWestern blot\nWhole cellular extracts were prepared by lysing 3×106 of cells in a NP-40-based lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors, proteinase inhibitors (Roche and Thermo Scientific), and 0.5 M EDTA. The concentration of protein was measured by Bradford assay (Themo Scientific). Samples (25 µg) were boiled for 5 min and resolved on 10% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Bio-rad). Resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Anti-rabbit IRF3, anti-rabbit phospho-IRF3 (Ser396), anti-mouse IκBα, anti-mouse phospho-IκBα (Ser32/36), and anti-rabbit IgG (HRP-conjugated) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-mouse GAPDH was purchased from Sigma. Anti-mouse IgG and anti-mouse IgG1 (HRP-conjugated) were purchased from Jackson Immunologicals. Lumi-Light western blotting substrate was used for HRP detection (Roche).\n\nSeV defective particles (DPs) purification\nDP purification was performed as previously described [24]. In short, allantoic fluid from 100 infected hen eggs was pooled and concentrated by high-speed centrifugation. Pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/2 mM EDTA and incubated overnight at 4°C in a 5–45% sucrose (Fisher) gradient that was prepared using a gradient maker (BioComp). Gradients were centrifuged at 4°C for 1.5 h at 28,000 rpm and fractions containing low-density viral particles were collected, pelleted, suspended and re-purified using the same procedure. Collected low-density fractions were concentrated by centrifugation at 4°C for 2 h at 21,000 rpm. Pellets were suspended in PBS, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C. The content of DI particles was determined by calculating the ratio of infectious over non-infectious particles as described above.\n\nRescue of recombinant virus\nA 591 nt long product containing the sequence of the T7 promoter followed by the 546-nucleotide long copy back DVG from SeV Cantell, and flanked by the restriction enzymes SpeI and SapI at the 3′ an 5′ ends was synthetically synthetized (DNA 2.0) and clone into the pSL1180 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the sequences for the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and the T7 polymerase terminator. In order to optimize the transcription of the DVG, 3 G residues were introduced downstream of the T7 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, CA) using the oligonucleotides 5′CCACTAGTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACCAGACAAGAGTTTAAGAG-3′ and 5′CTCTTAAACTCTTGTCTGGTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAACTAGTGG-3′. BSR-T7 cells were infected with a moi of approximately 66 of partially inactivated SeV strain 52. Virus inactivation was performed by exposing diluted virus to UV light (254 nm model MRL-58, UVP Upland, CA) for 53 sec at a distance of 9 inches from the light source. Virus inactivation diminished the virus replication rate, while allowing the expression of viral proteins necessary for the replication of DVGs. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h before transfection of 3 µg of vector encoding DVG. Transfection was performed with XtremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% NaCO3, 0.5 µg/ml trypsin (Worthington) and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated in 7% CO2 at 37°C. Cells and supernatant containing SeV 52 and rDPs were harvested after 48 h and 200 µl of the suspension were inoculated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day embryonated hen eggs (B & E Eggs, Silver Springs, PA). After 40 h allantoic fluid was harvest and 200 µl of undiluted fluid were inoculate in 10-day embryonated eggs for virus growth and egg inoculation was repeated for three consecutive passages. Allantoic fluid from the third passage was quick-frozen in dried ice/ethanol and used for infections. Presence of recombinant DVG was confirmed by PCR. No other DVGs were detected.\n\nRNA treatments\nDVG RNA was in vitro transcribed (Ambion) from the T7-DVG 546 plasmid. Standard genomic RNA was extracted from SeV Cantell LD stocks. To remove 5′-triphosphates, 1 µg of RNA was incubated with 10 U of Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (New England BioLabs) for 60 min at 37°C. To cleave single stranded RNA, 1 µg of RNA was incubated with 1 ng of RNase A (Ambion) for 15 min at room temperature. To cleave double stranded RNA, RNA was incubated with 0.1 U of RNase V1 (Ambion) for 15 min at room temperature. After treatments, RNA was purified using TRIzol or precipitation/inactivation buffer according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nRNA transfection\nLLC-MK2 cells were transfected with 250 ng or indicated doses of DVG and genomic RNA using lipofectamin 2000 (invitrogen). At 4 hours post transfection, the cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nFlow cytometry and sorting\nInfected IFNβ-YFP cells were collected at 6 h post-infection. Reporter mice were sacrificed 3 days post-infection. Lungs were collected and dissociated with collagenase (Roche), followed by suspension on 0.5 M EDTA and RBC lysis buffer. Single cell suspensions were then incubated with CD16/CD32 FcBlock for 20 min at 4C, followed by incubation with biotinylated mouse anti-CD45.2. Washed cells were incubated with anti-biotin microbeads (Miltenyi) for 20 min and passed through a magnetic column for negative selection. CD45− cells were sorted based on YFP expression using a FACS Vantage SE sorter.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed as indicated in each figure.

Reliable methods for non-invasive BAT measurement in human infants have yet to be demonstrated. The current study first validates methods for quantitative BAT imaging of rodents post mortem followed by BAT excision and re-imaging of excised tissues. Identical methods are then employed in a cohort of in vivo infants to establish the reliability of these measures and provide normative statistics for BAT depot volume and fat fraction. Using multi-echo water-fat MRI, fat- and water-based images of rodents and neonates were acquired and ratios of fat to the combined signal from fat and water (fat signal fraction) were calculated. Neonatal scans (n = 22) were acquired during natural sleep to quantify BAT and WAT deposits for depot volume and fat fraction. Acquisition repeatability was assessed based on multiple scans from the same neonate. Intra- and inter-rater measures of reliability in regional BAT depot volume and fat fraction quantification were determined based on multiple segmentations by two raters. Rodent BAT was characterized as having significantly higher water content than WAT in both in situ as well as ex vivo imaging assessments. Human neonate deposits indicative of bilateral BAT in spinal, supraclavicular and axillary regions were observed. Pairwise, WAT fat fraction was significantly greater than BAT fat fraction throughout the sample (ΔWAT-BAT = 38%, p<10−4). Repeated scans demonstrated a high voxelwise correlation for fat fraction (Rall = 0.99). BAT depot volume and fat fraction measurements showed high intra-rater (ICCBAT,VOL = 0.93, ICCBAT,FF = 0.93) and inter-rater reliability (ICCBAT,VOL = 0.86, ICCBAT,FF = 0.93). This study demonstrates the reliability of using multi-echo water-fat MRI in human neonates for quantification throughout the torso of BAT depot volume and fat fraction measurements.\n"],"title":"Brown Adipose Tissue Quantification in Human Neonates Using Water-Fat Separated MRI","materials_and_methods":["\nRodent Imaging of BAT\nThis study was executed according to the recommendations found in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California at Irvine. Six two-month old Sprague-Dawley rats (250–275 g) were imaged post mortem simultaneously in a sealed and decontaminated container. Deposits of iBAT were then excised from the interscapular region along with WAT deposits from the perirenal region. The excised tissue was placed in glass tubes and immediately imaged. All imaging occurred within a three-hour period of animal sacrifice to minimize post mortem effects on the tissue. MRI was performed on a Siemens 3 T Tim Trio system (VB17 software) using a 12-channel head coil. Scans were conducted using a vendor-supplied chemical-shift two-point 3D gradient echo [20] Dixon method (TR = 7.47 ms, TE1/TE2 = 2.45/3.675 ms, NA = 16, BW/pixel = 977 Hz, FA = 10, Matrix = 512×320×160, 0.97×0.97×1 mm, Scan Time = 3 min 2 s).\n\nNeonatal Imaging\nInfant imaging was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California at Irvine, and all parents provided informed, written consent. After feeding and soothing to the point of sleep, neonates were placed in a CIVCO beaded pillow (www.civco.com), covering body and head, that becomes rigid under vacuum providing a comforting swaddle, motion prevention and hearing protection when used in conjunction with standard foam earplugs. A pediatric specialist throughout the duration of scans observed neonates, monitoring for heart rate and oxygen saturation via a pulse oximeter attached to the foot. Scans were aborted in all cases of wakefulness within the neonate. The entire protocol included T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion tensor and functional imaging of the brain. Of the 25 subjects who were initially imaged, 3 were excluded prior to analysis due to fat/water swapping arising from the ambiguity of phase greater than 2π [21], [22] in the regions that contain BAT depots identified in this work (supraclavicular, axillary, spine), resulting in a final sample of 22 subjects (9 males and 13 females). All infants were from healthy pregnancies with no known obstetric, birth or current health complications. In terms of race/ethnicity approximately one half of the study sample was Non-Hispanic White (N = 13), whereas the other infants were either Hispanic White (N = 6) or Hispanic of other race (N = 3). The mean infant age at assessment was 23.6±11.7 (±SD) days and ranged from 11 to 56 days. Subjects were imaged during natural sleep using a combination of a 12-channel head receive coil and a posterior neck coil. An anterior neck coil was added to increase the signal to noise ratio when infant size could accommodate it (N = 17). The field of view was defined as just superior to the lower jaw down to the lower abdomen, with a fixed size. Imaging parameters were matched to the rodent imaging parameters, albeit with a single average resulting in a shorter scan time to minimize in vivo motion artifact.\n\nImage Processing and Segmentation\nVoxelwise fat fraction (FF) maps were created from water and fat separated volumes (Figure 1) derived directly from the Siemens operating system, a feature readily available on most clinical platforms. The ratio of fat to the combined signal intensity from both fat and water used in this work is a fat signal fraction based on a two-point excitation incapable of accounting for the multiple peak resonances of fat and indirect dipole-dipole coupling. Hand drawn ROIs were used to extract FF from excised tissue samples and post mortem BAT regions (Figure 2). Thresholds for classifying BAT were determined based on a receiver operator characteristic analysis of the ex vivo samples. At an upper threshold of 60% FF, BAT was correctly classified 99% of the time with a WAT false positive of less than 10%. At a lower threshold of 20% FF, BAT was correctly classified 99.9% of the time.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077907.g001Figure 1\nExample Water, Fat and Fat Signal Fraction Images.\nExample images of water (left) and fat (middle) separation based on the opposed-phase imaging are shown. Fat signal fraction (right) is defined as the ratio of fat to the combined signal from fat and water.

(A) In situ and ex vivo samples of BAT (brown adipose tissue) and WAT (white adipose tissue). (B) Single slice fat fraction map of ex vivo tissues in glass vials.\n\nNeonate BAT masks were created for visualization based on the following voxel attributes: 1) total signal greater than two standard deviations (SD) above the entire image mean (including background noise), 2) fat signal greater than one SD below the entire image mean, and 3) FF greater than 20% with no upper bound. Fat fraction values were overlaid on in-phase volumes to highlight individual differences in BAT depot volume, distribution and composition between subjects (Figure 3).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077907.g003Figure 3\nFat Fraction In Three Planes.\nThree-plane view of BAT (brown adipose tissue) in a participant with relatively large (bottom row) and small (top row) deposits. Arrows in the axial and coronal views indicate supraclavicular/axillary BAT. Arrows in the sagittal view indicate bilateral spinal BAT deposits. Underlay volume is the in-phase echo.\n\nBAT and WAT deposits were segmented (Figure 4) and quantified for depot volume and fat fraction in all subjects using a semi-automated intensity-based process [23]. BAT was segmented in ITK-SNAP (www.itksnap.org) by applying a threshold filter limiting FF values between 20% and 60%. Seed points for active contour segmentation were manually placed in deposits close to lateral processes along the spine and in supraclavicular, and axillary regions. Seed bubbles of 3 mm were used to roughly cover these areas while avoiding any subcutaneous WAT partial volume regions. Supraclavicular ROIs were limited to four seed points per side, axillary to four seeds per side, and one seed per side on each vertebrae, ensuring consistent definition. Vertebral ROIs were limited to the first five thoracic vertebrae (T1–T5) in order to maintain well-defined and consistent boundaries for definition between raters. The active contour evolution was iterated until the contours were visually covered by label, between 40 and 60 iterations. Iterations were constrained to 50 in the more heterogeneous supraclavicular and axillary regions to avoid bleeding into neighboring voxels. WAT was segmented using the fat-only image and thresholding for values above the lowest quartile. A single seed of 5 mm was placed in the subcutaneous nuchal area of the neck to avoid regions contaminated by fat and water signal swap. The active contour evolution was iterated 100 times. Mean FF and total depot volume were computed for each of the three segmented BAT regions and one nuchal WAT region. An additional ROI mask containing the union of supraclavicular and axillary regions was also assessed to account for the occasionally ambiguous border between the supraclavicular and axillary regions.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077907.g004Figure 4\nNeonatal Segmentations.\nBAT (brown adipose tissue) segmentations in the neonate.

A recent transcriptome analysis of syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii in Arabidopsis roots has shown that thousands of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated in syncytia as compared to root segments from uninfected plants. Among the down-regulated genes are many which code for WRKY transcription factors. Arabidopsis contains 66 WRKY genes with 59 represented by the ATH1 GeneChip. Of these, 28 were significantly down-regulated and 6 up-regulated in syncytia as compared to control root segments. We have studied here the down-regulated genes WRKY6, WRKY11, WRKY17 and WRKY33 in detail. We confirmed the down-regulation in syncytia with promoter::GUS lines. Using various overexpression lines and mutants it was shown that the down-regulation of these WRKY genes is important for nematode development, probably through interfering with plant defense reactions. In case of WRKY33, this might involve the production of the phytoalexin camalexin.\n"],"title":"The Beet Cyst Nematode Heterodera schachtii Modulates the Expression of WRKY Transcription Factors in Syncytia to Favour Its Development in Arabidopsis Roots","materials_and_methods":["\nPlant cultivation\nArabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col) plants were grown in soil in a growth room at 25°C in long day conditions (16 h light/8 hour dark). For growth in sterile conditions, seeds were surface sterilized for 7 min in 10% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite. They were then washed three times with sterile water and placed in Petri dishes (9 cm) on either a modified Knop medium with 2% sucrose [3] or on MS medium containing 3% sucrose [33].\n\nOverexpression, promoter::GUS fusion and mutant lines\nThe promoter::GUS and overexpression constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 for transformation of Arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method [34]. Selection of transgenic plants was done according to Szakazits et al. [35] for the pPZP3425 vectors and Ali et al. [36] for the pMAA-Red derivative.\nFor the overexpression constructs of WRKY33 (At2g38470) and MKK4 (At1g51660), the protein coding sequence was amplified from cDNAs using RNA isolated from 14-d-old roots. The primers used to amplify the WRKY33 coding sequence (cWRKY33forNco and cWRKY33revBam) from cDNA are given in Table S1. In case of WRKY33 overexpression constructs, the WRKY coding sequence was driven by three promoters in the expression cassette of the vector pPZP3425 [35]. The CaMV35S promoter was used for constitutive overexpression [37], while Arabidopsis Pdf2.1 and MIOX5 promoters were used for driving the expression of WRKY33 specifically in syncytia [13], [38]. In case of MKK4, only the Pdf2.1 promoter was used for its syncytium specific expression using the vector pMAA-Red [36]. For amplification of the genes from cDNA or genomic DNA, Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) was used. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.\nThe Pdf2.1::pPZP3425 construct has been described (Siddique et al. 2011). The MIOX5 promoter was amplified from genomic DNA (ecotype Col) using the primers listed in Table S1 which introduced an upstream EcoRI site and an NcoI site at the start codon. After digestion with these enzymes, this PCR fragment was used to replace the CaMV promoter in pPZP3425 digested with the same enzymes resulting in MIOX5::pPZP3425.\nNcoI and BamHI restriction sites were used for insertion of coding sequences in the vectors. The coding sequence of MKK4 has an endogenous BamHI site which was removed by an overlapping PCR using the primers MKK4forNco2, MKK4Mfor, MKK4Mrev and MKK4revBam (Table S1). These primers also introduced 2 mutations (T224D and S230D) which render MKK4 constitutively active [39], [40], resulting in MKK4DD.\nEight homozygous lines from the WRKY33 overexpression construct with CaMV promoter were evaluated for transcript abundance using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using primers WRKY33RTfor and WRKY33RTrev (Table S1). For RT-PCR RNA was isolated from 15 days old seedlings and two lines showing high expression levels were selected for nematode resistance tests. For the constructs MIOX5::WRKY33, Pdf2.1::WRKY33, and Pdf2.1::MKKDD selection at the seedling level by RT-PCR was not possible because the promoters are not active in these tissues. Therefore 8 lines each were challenged with H. schachtii in preliminary resistance tests to select lines according to their susceptibility (Figure S1). For the WRKY33 constructs 2 transgenic lines were analyzed in detail while for the Pdf2.1::MKKDD construct 3 lines were further analyzed.\nThe promoter region 1700 bp upstream the start codon of the WRKY17 gene (At2g24570) was amplified by PCR (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase from Thermo Scientific) using 50 ng Arabidopsis Col genomic DNA as template. The primer pair used for amplification of the promoter region was promWRKY17forEcoRI and promWRKY17revNcoI (Table S1). Primers included restriction sites for EcoRI and NcoI for subsequent cloning into the binary vector pMAA-Red [36]. During the cloning procedure the 35S promoter was exchanged by the promoter fragment of WRKY17. Seven homozygous lines were developed for the pWRKY17::GUS fusion construct and their expression pattern was tested. Four lines with a similar expression pattern were selected and one of these was used for a detailed GUS expression analysis.\nThe WRKY33::GUS line (Lippok et al. 2007), overexpression line 35S::WRKY6-9, wrky6-2 mutant, and the pWRKY6::GUS line [32] were all provided by Dr. Imre E. Somssich (Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Breeding, Department of Plant-Microbe Interactions, Koln, Germany). The wrky33-1 mutant line [28] was provided by Dr. Michael K. Deyholos (Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). The single and double mutants of WRKY11 and WRKY17 (wrky11-1, wrky17-1 and wrky11-wrky17) and promoter::GUS line of WRKY11 [41] were provided by Dr. Thomas Kroj (Laboratory of Plant-Microorganism Interactions, Castanet Tolosan, France). The phytoalexin deficient pad3-1 mutant line (N3805) was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis stock center.\n\nNematode infection and resistance test\nH. schachtii cysts were harvested from sterile in vitro stock cultures propagated on mustard (Sinapsis alba cv Albatros) roots growing on 0.2x concentrated Knop medium supplemented with 2% sucrose [3]. The cysts were soaked in 3 mM ZnCl2 to stimulate hatching of J2 larvae under sterile conditions. The J2 larvae were then washed three times in sterile water and resuspended in 0.5% (w/v) Gelrite (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) before inoculation. Different overexpression and mutant lines together with wild type plants were grown on Knop medium in 9 cm Petri dishes (10 seedlings per plate) as described above in a growth chamber with a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle at 23°C. The roots of twelve-d-old Arabidopsis plants were inoculated under sterile conditions with about 50–60 juveniles per plant. Before inoculation with H. schachtii, total root length of each plant was estimated as described [42]. At 14 dpi, 15 syncytia associated with female nematodes were randomly selected and photographed under an inverse microscope (Axiovert 200 M; Zeiss, Hallerbergmoos, Germany) having an integrated camera (AxioCam MRc5; Zeiss). Syncytia and female nematodes were measured using the AxioVision 4 software (Zeiss, Hallerbergmoos, Germany). Examples are shown in Figure S2. Afterwards, female and male nematodes were counted and the number of males and females per cm of root length was calculated at 15 dpi. Three independent biological replicates were performed with a gap of 1 week between the replicates. One replicate consisted of 5 plates with 10 plants per plate; thus a total of 150 plants was analysed per line. The data regarding number of nematodes and sizes of nematodes and syncytia were analysed using single factor ANOVA (P<0.05, P<0.01) and T-Test (P<0.05).\n\nHistochemical GUS analysis\nHistochemical detection of GUS activity was done with X-gluc (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) as substrate in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Triton-X 100, 0.5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], 0.5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] and 10 mM Na2EDTA [43]. For GUS staining of syncytia infection was done as described above and infected roots from different time points were then incubated with X-gluc overnight at 37°C. The stained syncytia and uninfected roots were photographed as described above.\n\nRNA isolation\nPlant samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Machery & Nagel, genXpress) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored immediately at −80°C. The RNA preparation included DNase digestion. However, since this DNase treatment did not completely remove the DNA in the sample, the remaining DNA was digested using Ambion DNA-free DNase Treatment and Removal Reagents (Invitrogen) for some experiments. RNA was quantified using NanoDrop (NanoDrop 2000c from PEQLAB).\n\nReverse Transcriptase (RT-PCR) and quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nRT-PCR was done using the RT-PCR Master Mix (USB) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For cDNA synthesis Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (oligo(dN)6) according to the manufactures instructions were used. The RNA concentration was approximately 100 ng/µl and 10 µl was used in a total volume of 20 µl. The qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detector and results were calculated using the Sequence Detection Software SDS v2.0 (Applied BioSystems). Each qRT-PCR sample contained 12.5 µl Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix with UDG and ROX (Invitrogen), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 µl forward and reverse primer (10 µM), 2 µl cDNA and water to make a 25 µl total reaction volume. The primer pairs used for qRT-PCR for WRKY33 were WRKY33qRTfor and WRKY33qRTrev (Table S1). Dissociation runs were performed to exclude the formation of primer dimers. The 18S gene was used as an internal reference and relative expression was calculated by the (1+E)−ΔΔCt method [44].\n\nStatistical analysis of microarray data\nAffymetrix CEL files were analyzed using packages of the Bioconductor suite (www.bioconductor.org). Our approach follows established practice and has been described in detail before [4]. In brief, for the statistical tests, individual gene variances have been moderated using an Empirical Bayes approach as in related studies [13]. Further information is available in the online methods (File S1). Tests were restricted to the 59 WRKY genes included on the GeneChip representing most of the 66 genes recognised by Wang et al. [45] and containing the originally described WRKY gene subgroups [16]. This considerably increased the statistical power of the testing procedure as it reduces the necessary correction for massive multiple testing.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065718","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nThe morphogenic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates postnatal cerebellar development and its aberrant activation leads to medulloblastoma. The transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 are the activators of Hh pathway and their function is finely controlled by different covalent modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. We show here that Gli2 is endogenously acetylated and that this modification represents a key regulatory step for Hedgehog signaling. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) coactivator p300, but not other HATs, acetylates Gli2 at the conserved lysine K757 thus inhibiting Hh target gene expression. By generating a specific anti acetyl-Gli2(Lys757) antisera we demonstrated that Gli2 acetylation is readily detectable at endogenous levels and is attenuated by Hh agonists. Moreover, Gli2 K757R mutant activity is higher than wild type Gli2 and is no longer enhanced by Hh agonists, indicating that acetylation represents an additional level of control for signal dependent activation. Consistently, in sections of developing mouse cerebella Gli2 acetylation correlates with the activation status of Hedgehog signaling. Mechanistically, acetylation at K757 prevents Gli2 entry into chromatin. Together, these data illustrate a novel mechanism of regulation of the Hh signaling whereby, in concert with Gli1, Gli2 acetylation functions as a key transcriptional checkpoint in the control of morphogen-dependent processes.\n"],"title":"Gli2 Acetylation at Lysine 757 Regulates Hedgehog-Dependent Transcriptional Output by Preventing Its Promoter Occupancy","materials_and_methods":["\nCell cultures and treatments\nHEK293T and NIH3T3 cells were cultured as previously described [5].

Here we show that in C. elegans, the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins specify neurite branching sites in the PLM mechanosensory neurons. Wnts function through MIG-1/Frizzled and the planar cell polarity protein (PCP) VANG-1/Strabismus/Vangl2 to restrict the formation of F-actin patches, which mark branching sites in nascent neurites. We find that VANG-1 promotes Wnt signaling by facilitating Frizzled endocytosis and genetically acts in a common pathway with arr-1/β-arrestin, whose mutation results in defective PLM branching and F-actin patterns similar to those in the Wnt, mig-1 or vang-1 mutants. On the other hand, the UNC-6/Netrin pathway intersects orthogonally with Wnt-PCP signaling to guide PLM branch growth along the dorsal-ventral axis. Our study provides insights for how attractive and repulsive signals coordinate to sculpt neurite branching patterns, which are critical for circuit connectivity.\nAuthor summary: Extrinsic cues instruct neurite branching patterns through cytoskeletal remodeling at precise locations. We show that the Wnt glycoproteins signal through the Frizzled receptor and the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) protein VANG-1 to instruct neurite branching in the nematode C. elegans, by restricting F-actin assembly to positions along the nascent neurite where future branches emerge. VANG-1 facilitates Frizzled endocytosis and its subsequent signaling in the endosome, which is critical for shaping F-actin assembly. This Wnt-PCP-endosomal pathway intersects orthogonally with Netrin signaling to pattern neurite branching in the two-dimensional space.

The length of the PLM process and the distance between the PLM branch and the cell soma were analyzed using ImageJ [55]. Each animal was only scored for left or right PLM based on which side is clearly visible in the image. There was no side-to-side difference in PLM branch positions, so data from left and right PLMs were pooled for analyses. We define normal PLM branch locations as those that fall within 99% (mean ± 3 standard deviations) of PLM branch sites visualized by zdIs5(Pmec-4::GFP) in the wild type, which ranges from 0.46 to 0.88. The percentage of both proximally and distally mislocalized PLM branches in indicated genotypes was calculated and presented along with the scatter plots.\n\nMolecular biology and plasmid construction\nThe molecular cloning and plasmid construction were performed by standard molecular biology techniques. All of expression constructs used to generate the twnEx series of transgenes were in the pPD95.77 Fire vector backbone, including transgenes induced by heat shock (through the hsp-16.2 promoter).

Detailed information, including primer sequences, for cloning cor-1, vab-10b-ABD, cwn-1, egl-20, mig-1, vang-1, rab-5, and arr-1 are available upon request.\n\nHeat shock experiments\nFor heat shock experiments, animals with heat-shock inducible transgenes were grown on NGM plates at 20°C, transferred to 34°C for 30 minutes at early L1 stage, and recovered at 20°C for another 24 hours before the branch locations were scored.\n\nWestern blotting and co-immunoprecipitation\nHEK293 cells were transfected by lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% sodium deoxylcholate, 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1M dithiothreitol) with 1% NP-40. For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA (Invitrogen) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) beads. Immuno-complexes or samples for western blot analysis were electrophoresed in a SDS-polyacryalamide gel, transferred onto PVDF membrane and probed with anti-HA Y-11(1:4000, Santa Cruz) or anti-FLAG (1:5000, Sigma) antibodies.\n\nTime lapse imaging of PLM branch development\nTo immobilize worms without interfering with animal development, we used the unc-54(e190) mutation to genetically paralyze the animals. The unc-54 mutation did not affect PLM development. We placed early L1 larva and 2–4 μl polystyrene beads (0.1 μm, Polysciences Inc.) on 5% gel pad. The cover slip was sealed by vaseline to prevent desiccation.\n\nConfocal microscopy and quantification of MIG-1 and VANG-1 subcellular localization\nz-stack maximum projection images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 700 Confocal Imaging System (Carl Zeiss). Pixel-wise colocalization of GFP and mCherry fluorescence signal was quantified using the Zeiss Zen imaging software. For the quantification of MIG-1 or VANG-1 cytosolic localization, myristolated mCherry was expressed to label the cell membrane of the touch neurons. Using Zeiss Zen software, total and cytosolic MIG-1::GFP signal intensity was derived by first quantifying each single optical sections of the z-stack confocal images that span most of the thickness of the PLM cell body, followed by summation of data from individual optical sections to calculate the cytosolic/total signal intensity ratio.\n\nAnalysis of COR-1 localization\nHeat maps of COR-1::mCherry intensity in the PLM process were generated from z-stack maximum projection images using ImageJ. Ten individual PLMs were assembled into a single aligned heat map of COR-1 intensity for each genotype.\n\nStatistics analysis\nThe ANOVA, Student’s t test, Mann-Whitney U test and two proportion z test were conducted in MS Office Excel or Prism for experiments indicated in the Figure Legends, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Error bars represent standard error of means (S.E.M.).\n\nEthics statement\nThis study does not involve any human subject, non-human primates and other vertebrates.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/title","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065717/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065717/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/references","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/body","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/introduction","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006720/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164558","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":[""],"title":"Correction: Endoscopic Gold Fiducial Marker Placement into the Bladder Wall to Optimize Radiotherapy Targeting for Bladder-Preserving Management of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Feasibility and Initial Outcomes"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164558/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164558/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164558/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164558/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176843/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nUnderstanding the ecological factors that regulate elasmobranch abundance in nearshore waters is essential to effectively manage coastal ecosystems and promote conservation. However, little is known about elasmobranch populations in the western South Atlantic Ocean. An 8-year, standardized longline and drumline survey conducted in nearshore waters off Recife, northeastern Brazil, allowed us to describe the shark assemblage and to monitor abundance dynamics using zero-inflated generalized additive models. This region is mostly used by several carcharhinids and one ginglymostomid, but sphyrnids are also present. Blacknose sharks, Carcharhinus acronotus, were mostly mature individuals and declined in abundance throughout the survey, contrasting with nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum, which proliferated possibly due to this species being prohibited from all harvest since 2004 in this region. Tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, were mostly juveniles smaller than 200 cm and seem to use nearshore waters off Recife between January and September. No long-term trend in tiger shark abundance was discernible. Spatial distribution was similar in true coastal species (i.e. blacknose and nurse sharks) whereas tiger sharks were most abundant at the middle continental shelf. The sea surface temperature, tidal amplitude, wind direction, water turbidity, and pluviosity were all selected to predict shark abundance off Recife. Interspecific variability in abundance dynamics across spatiotemporal and environmental gradients suggest that the ecological processes regulating shark abundance are generally independent between species, which could add complexity to multi-species fisheries management frameworks. Yet, further research is warranted to ascertain trends at population levels in the South Atlantic Ocean.\n"],"title":"Structure and Dynamics of the Shark Assemblage off Recife, Northeastern Brazil","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics statement\nThe data used in this research was obtained with full approval of the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (permit no. 15083–8), which included authorization to sample a protected species, i.e. the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum.\n\nSampling procedure\nThis study used data from a longline and drumline survey targeting large sharks off Recife (8°10′S, 34°53′W), northeastern Brazil, from May 2004 to December 2011 [41]–[42]. The study area comprised two adjacent, nearshore fishing sites, hereafter referred to as Boa Viagem (BV) and Paiva (PA), between the 3-m and 18-m isobaths (Fig. 1). BV is a widely urbanized beach and has greater habitat complexity due to the presence of an alongshore, shallow reef [42], whereas PA is a comparatively undeveloped region with a relatively monotonous bathymetric profile that includes the Jaboatão estuary in its northernmost section. A total of 1,130 fishing cruises, generally comprising four consecutive fishing sets in each site, were conducted on a weekly basis. Bottom longline gear was deployed late afternoon and retrieved in the following dawn, whereas drumlines were inspected at dawn for bait refurbishment. Longlines were composed of a 4-km long mainline with 100 hooks and were deployed alongshore, ∼1.5−3 km away from the coastline (Fig. 1). Drumlines, numbering 13 off BV and 10 off PA, were composed of an 18-m long, vertically-stretched mainline with 2 hooks and were deployed ∼0.5−1 km from the coastline. Additionally, 38 bottom longline sets (200 hooks each) were occasionally conducted at the middle continental shelf (CS) between the 25- and 40-m isobaths. Altogether, the fishing effort in this study totaled 280,079 deployed hooks. Circle hooks (17/0, 10° offset) baited mostly with Gymnothorax moray eel (∼300 g) were used, but J-style hooks (9/0, 0° offset) were also used until May 2006 for hook-performance comparison [43]. Also, a Styrofoam float was attached to the proximal end of terminal tackles in order to suspend all hooks in the water column since September 2005. Yet, because such modification significantly influenced catchability [43], the period from May 2004 to August 2005 was discarded from abundance analyses. All fishing sets followed the same rigorous methodology so that the influence of fishing gear and procedure on species catchability could be standardized. Further details on the fishing methodology and fishing effort are thoroughly described in [42], whereas an environmental description of the study area can be found in [41]. While both longlines and drumlines were used for fishing, drumline data were discarded from abundance analyses because both fishing gears had distinct efforts and spatial arrangements which could potentially confound interpretation of catch rate data.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102369.g001Figure 1\nStudy area.\nMap of the littoral of Recife, northeastern Brazil, depicting the locations of a shallow alongshore reef (stripped blue ellipse off Boa Viagem) and both bottom longline (solid gray ellipses located seaward) and drumline (blank striped ellipses located shoreward) deployments in two nearshore fishing sites.\n\nAll sharks caught were identified, sexed, and measured for stretched total length (TL) to the nearest centimeter. Several environmental parameters were monitored after deploying and retrieving the longline gear. Sea surface temperature (±0.01°C) and salinity (±0.1 ups) were measured with a YSI 556 multiprobe. Water transparency (±0.5 m) was measured with a Secchi disc. Tidal amplitude (±0.1 m) for the Port of Recife was obtained from the Hydrographic and Navigation Directory of the Brazilian Navy (http://www.mar.mil.br/dhn/chm/tabuas/index.htm). The day of the lunar cycle was obtained from http://kalender-365.de/calendario-lunar-pt.php, with the new-moon day corresponding to the first day of the cycle. Meteorological variables such as daily pluviosity (mm), wind direction (0−360°) and speed (m·s−1), and cumulative solar radiation (kW·h·m−2) were obtained from the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies of the National Institute for Space Research (http://sinda.crn2.inpe.br/PCD/historico/consulta_pcdm.jsp) for the region of Recife between May 2004 and December 2011.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed on the most abundant shark species (>50 individuals caught). Size and sex compositions were assessed for each of such species and differences in mean total length between males and females were assessed with 2-sample t-tests. Deviances from the 1∶1 sex ratio were assessed with chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests were used to compare total lengths between years and between quarters. Whenever significant differences between quarters were detected, a post-hoc, multiple comparison procedure [44] was used to investigate which quarters were different. Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to detect significant shifts in sex ratio across years and quarters for each species.\nBecause longline sets within fishing cruises could not be considered independent sampling [42], catch and effort data were aggregated by fishing cruise and environmental variables were averaged by fishing cruise for abundance analyses. A 2-sample t test was used to assess for differences in longline soak time between nearshore fishing sites. A total of 12 candidate predictors of species abundance were considered: year, month, fishing site, lunar day, sea surface temperature, salinity, visibility, tidal amplitude, pluviosity, wind direction, wind speed, and cumulative solar radiation. All predictors but fishing site were interpreted as continuous variables. Further details on predictor variables, including the abbreviations hereafter used, can be found in Table 1. Possible correlations between predictors were investigated in order to avoid including correlated variables in the same model. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, s, was assessed for all pairwise combinations of continuous predictors. Additionally, the significance of Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient, r, was assessed using Student’s t distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom to test the null hypothesis ρ = 0 [45]. Also, 95% confidence intervals for r were calculated using Fisher’s Z transformation [46]. Both procedures were conducted using the cor.test function in STATS R-library [47]. Correlation coefficients lower than 0.3 were considered small [48]. The existence of correlation between predictors were identified when three criteria were met, namely i) the null hypothesis that ρ = 0 was rejected (p<0.05), ii) the highest absolute value in the confidence interval for ρ was greater or equal than 0.3, and iii) either the absolute value of s or the lowest absolute value of the confidence interval for ρ were greater or equal than 0.3. Whenever a problematic correlation was detected, the responsible covariates were not used simultaneously in any model. Although the value 0.3 is subjective in the sense that any other low value could be used, it proved to be effective because it allowed us to discard the most correlated covariates while preserving nearly 80% of the combinations between weakly correlated or uncorrelated predictors.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102369.t001Table 1\nSelected predictive variables.\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nAbbreviation\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSite\nsite\nCategorical\nBoa Viagem (BV), Paiva (PA)\n\n\nYear\nyear\nContinuous\n2005−2011\n\n\nMonth\nmonth\nContinuous\n1−12\n\n\nLunar day\nlunday\nContinuous\nThe day number of the lunar cycle, starting in new-moon day\n\n\nTemperature\ntemp\nContinuous\nSea surface temperature, in degrees\n\n\nSalinity\nsalin\nContinuous\nPractical salinity units\n\n\nVisibility\nvisib\nContinuous\nWater visibility, in meters\n\n\nTidal amplitude\ntidamp\nContinuous\nDifference between highest and lowest tidal height per day\n\n\nPluviosity\npluvio\nContinuous\nRainfall in milimeters\n\n\nWind direction\nwinddir\nContinuous\nDirection in 0−360 degrees, clockwise\n\n\nWind speed\nwindspe\nContinuous\nVelocity in meters per second\n\n\nCumulative solar radiation\nsolarrad\nContinuous\nTotal solar radiation per day, in kiloWatts·hour per square meter\n\n\n\nDescription of the predictive variables used to model elasmobranch abundance off Recife.\nModeling the abundance of sharks is often complicated by a large amount of zero-valued observations, which may yield zero-inflated distributions [49]. A general approach to nonparametric regression analysis with zero-inflated data consists on modeling the response distribution as a probabilistic mixture of zero and a regular component whose distribution belongs to the exponential family [50]. Generalized additive models (GAM) are widely used for modeling nonlinear effects of covariates in quantitative studies [51]–[52] and can be extended for such data, resulting in zero-inflated generalized additive models (ZIGAM) [53]–[54]. However, the ZIGAM approach implicitly assumes that the zero-inflation process is uncoupled from the regular model component, which may not always be true. A recently developed alternative, the constrained zero-inflated generalized additive model (COZIGAM) approach, implicitly assumes that the probability of non-zero inflation and the mean non-zero-inflated population abundance are linearly related on some link scales [55].\nCatch data for each species were fitted against each of the predictive variables individually using GAM and ZIGAM to assess if the distribution of the data was zero-inflated. While zero-inflated models proved to be the best alternative, the COZIGAM was also fitted to the data in order to make comparisons with the larger (more parameters) ZIGAM. This allowed us to verify the independence of the non-zero-inflated data generation process relative to the zero-inflated process. The type of model which generally exhibited best performance was selected for the analysis. Modeling was conducted with COZIGAM R-library [55]. The Poisson distribution was used to model the non-zero-inflated process, whereas the binomial distribution was used to model the zero-inflated process. The thin-plate regression spline was used as a penalized smoothing basis, and the k dimensions of the basis representing the smoothing terms were optimized for each predictor variable by running several univariate models with different k values and comparing their output. Parameter estimates were obtained with the EM algorithm [56] because typical procedures to obtain parameter estimates cannot be used when the state (i.e., the zero-inflated or the non-zero-inflated processes) which the zero-valued observations belong to is unknown [57]. A maximum of 250 interactions were allowed to occur for the algorithm to converge. The logarithm of fishing effort was included in the model as an offset covariate for standardization of the catch rate.\nGiven the particular nature of the covariate month, which may yield significant correlations with environmental variables most notably when seasonality is present, modeling was approached in two separate forms: the spatiotemporal model (SPT), which includes the covariates year, month, and site; and the environmental model (ENV), which includes the remaining covariates that are not correlated. Regarding SPT modeling, two different approaches were conducted, more precisely i) SPT1, comprising site as a factorial covariate and covariates year and month as independent smooth functions, and ii) SPT2, comprising site as a factorial covariate and covariates year and month linked by the same smoothing spline. Regarding ENV modeling, site was also included as a factor because the catch rates of some species were found to be significantly different between fishing sites. Predictive variables with higher effect on abundance were selected to be included in the ENV model with a forward stepwise approach [58]. The Bayesian approximated logarithmic marginal likelihood by Laplace method, logE, was used for model comparisons and selection [55]. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 2.14.0 [47].\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003715","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","abstract":["\nGram-negative bacterial pathogens deliver a variety of virulence proteins through the type III secretion system (T3SS) directly into the host cytoplasm. These type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) play an essential role in bacterial infection, mainly by targeting host immunity. However, the molecular basis of their functionalities remains largely enigmatic. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas syringae T3SE HopZ1a, a member of the widely distributed YopJ effector family, directly interacts with jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins through the conserved Jas domain in plant hosts. JAZs are transcription repressors of jasmonate (JA)-responsive genes and major components of the jasmonate receptor complex. Upon interaction, JAZs can be acetylated by HopZ1a through a putative acetyltransferase activity. Importantly, P. syringae producing the wild-type, but not a catalytic mutant of HopZ1a, promotes the degradation of HopZ1-interacting JAZs and activates JA signaling during bacterial infection. Furthermore, HopZ1a could partially rescue the virulence defect of a P. syringae mutant that lacks the production of coronatine, a JA-mimicking phytotoxin produced by a few P. syringae strains. These results highlight a novel example by which a bacterial effector directly manipulates the core regulators of phytohormone signaling to facilitate infection. The targeting of JAZ repressors by both coronatine toxin and HopZ1 effector suggests that the JA receptor complex is potentially a major hub of host targets for bacterial pathogens.\nAuthor Summary: Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens rely on the type III secretion system, which is a specialized protein secretion apparatus, to inject virulence proteins, called effectors, into the host cells. The type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) directly target host substrates in order to promote bacterial colonization and disease development. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the direct host targets of T3SEs provides important insights into virulence strategies employed by bacterial pathogens to cause diseases. Here, we report that the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae T3SE HopZ1a physically interacts with and modifies the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins in plant hosts. JAZ proteins are components of the receptor complex of the plant hormone jasmonates (JA) and key transcription repressors regulating JA-responsive genes. HopZ1a belongs to the widely distributed YopJ (for Yersinia Outer Protein J) family of T3SEs with a potential acetyltransferase activity. P. syringae producing HopZ1a, but not the catalytic mutant, leads to the degradation of AtJAZ1 during infection. As a result, HopZ1a activates JA signaling and promotes bacterial multiplication in Arabidopsis. This work provides the first example of a bacterial effector that subverts host immunity by directly targeting the receptor complex of a defense-associated hormone in plants.

Bacteria strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1.\n\nFluorescence microscopy\nTo construct plasmids for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, full-length cDNA of GmJAZ1 or AtJAZ6 and hopZ1a(C216A) were cloned into the vectors pSPYCE and pSPYNE [51], respectively. To examine the subcellular localization of GmJAZ1, full-length cDNA was cloned into the vector pEG101[52]. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1(pCH32), which were then used to infiltrate 3–4 week old Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a protocol described previously [14]. Functional fluorophore were visualized in the infiltrated leaves using a Leica SP2 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems) at 48 hpi for subcellular localization and BiFC. DAPI was used to stain the nucleus in plant cells [53], [54].\n\nIn vitro GST pull-down assays\nTo construct GST-fusion plasmids, the full-length hopZ1a gene was inserted into the vector pGEX4T-2 (GE Healthcare Life Science). GmJAZ1-HA gene was cloned into the vector pET14b (Navogen), which has 6×His in the N-terminus. The AtJAZ genes were cloned into the plasmid vector pET-Mal with maltose binding protein (MBP) in the N-terminus and 8×His in the C-terminus [55]. In vitro pull-down assays were carried out using GST pull-down protein∶protein interaction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, GST or GST-HopZ1a was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Soluble proteins were incubated with 50 µL glutathione agarose beads (Invitrogen) for one hour at 4°C. The beads were washed (20 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100) five times and then incubated with equal amount of bacterial lysates containing JAZ proteins at 4°C for overnight. The beads were washed five times again, and the presence of the JAZ proteins on the beads was detected by western blots using anti-HA or anti-His antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) ) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.).\n\nProtein analysis\nPseudomonas syringae expressing the hopZ1a-HA genes was induced in M63 minimal medium containing 1% fructose at room temperature overnight [50]. HopZ1 expression was detected by western blots using the anti-HA antibody.\nFor JAZ degradation assay in N. benthamiana, hopZ1a-HA or 3×FLAG-hopZ1a were co-expressed with GmJAZ1-FLAG or AtJAZ6-YFP-HA using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression as previously described [9], [56]. Leaf disks were collected at 20 hpi, and then grounded in 2×Laemmli buffer. The abundances of GmJAZ1 and AtJAZ6 were analyzed by western blots.\nFor the semi-in vitro protein degradation assay, GmJAZ1-FLAG and 3×FLAG-HopZ1a were over-expressed individually in N. benthamiana using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. Total proteins were extracted from the infected leaf tissues at 20 hpi using an extraction buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 10% Glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF. Protein extracts were mixed in equal volume for six hours at 4°C with gentle agitation before the abundance of GmJAZ1 was examined by western blots.\nFor the in vivo JAZ degradation assay, six-week-old 35S-HA-AtJAZ1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were hand infiltrated with bacterial suspensions of PtoDC3000 or PtoDC3118 carrying the empty vector (EV), expressing HopZ1a, HopZ1a(C216A) or AvrRpt2 at OD600 = 0.2 (approximately 2×108 cfu/mL). Leaves infiltrated with water were used as a negative control. Six hours post inoculation, total proteins were extracted from four leaf discs (0.5 cm2) in 100 µL of 2×SDS sample buffer. The lysates were incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The abundance of AtJAZ1 was then analyzed by western blots. Homozygous coi1-30 mutant plants were selected on 1/2×Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 50 µM JA. Seedlings that were insensitive to JA treatment, i.e. without inhibited root growth symptoms, were transplanted in soil and infected with P. syringae after six weeks.\n\nIn vitro acetylation assays\nHIS-GmJAZ1, HIS-SUMO-HopZ1a, HIS-SUMO-HopZ1a(C216A), HIS-SUMO-AtJAZ6, MBP-AtJAZ6-HIS, and MBP-AtJAZ6ΔJas-HIS were over-expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and then purified using nickel resins. HIS-SUMO-HopZ1a and HIS-SUMO-AtJAZ6 proteins were then cleaved by ULP1 protease, producing protein mixtures with both HIS-SUMO and either tag-free HopZ1a or AtJAZ6. The protein mixtures were incubated with nickel resin again and the tag-free HopZ1a or AtJAZ6 proteins were collected from the flow through. In a standard acetylation assay, 2 µg purified HopZ1a or HopZ1a(C216A) was incubated with 10 µg MBP-AtJAZ6, 5 µg AtJAZ6 or 1 µg GmJAZ1 at 30°C for one hour in 25 µL of reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM sodium butyrate, 1 µL [14C]-acetyl-CoA (55 µci/µmol,) and 100 nM IP6. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and acetylated proteins were detected by autoradiography as previously described [11], [26], [57] after exposure at −80°C for five days. After autoradiograph, the protein gels were removed from the filter paper and stained with Coomassie blue as a loading control.\n\nReal time RT-PCR\nThe transcript abundances of AtJAZ9, AtJAZ10 or AtICS1 in Arabidopsis leaf tissues were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad Laboratories) and an CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad Laboratories). Total RNA was isolated from three independent biological replicates using Trizol, and DNA was removed using DNase I (Fermentas). Reverse transcription was performed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) with 1 µg of total RNA in a 25 µL reaction. The cDNAs were then used as templates for real-time PCR using gene-specific primers, which are listed below. AtActin was used as internal standard when compared the expression of AtJAZ9 and AtJAZ10 in different treatment. AtUBQ5 was the internal control used for the normalization of AtICS1 expression.\nAtActin: 5′-GGTGTCATGGTTGGTATGGGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTCTGTGAGTAGAACTGGGTGC-3′\nAtJAZ9: 5′-ATGAGGTTAACGATGATGCTG-3′ and 5′-CTTAGCCTCCTGGAAATCTG-3′\nAtJAZ10: 5′-GTAGTTTCCGAGATATTCAAGGTG-3′ and 5′-GAACCGAACGAGATTTAGCC-3′\nAtUBQ5:5′-GACGCTTCATCTCGTCC-3′ and 5′-GTAAACGTAGGTGAGTCC-3′\nAtICS1: 5′-GGCAGGGAGACTTACG-3′ and 5′-AGGTCCCGCATACATT-3′\n\nIn planta bacterial multiplication assays\nArabidopsis plants were planted as previous described [30], [36]. The leaves of five-week old plants were dipped into the bacterial suspensions at an OD600 = 0.2 (approximately 2×108 cfu/mL) for 15 seconds.

We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes. In the sex-combined analyses, we identified one novel locus (TCF7L2/HABP2) for WHRadjBMI and eight previously established loci at P < 5×10−8: seven for BMI, and one for WHRadjBMI in African ancestry individuals. An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS. In the sex-stratified analyses, we identified three novel loci for BMI (INTS10/LPL and MLC1 in men, IRX4/IRX2 in women) and four for WHRadjBMI (SSX2IP, CASC8, PDE3B and ZDHHC1/HSD11B2 in women) in individuals of African ancestry or both African and European ancestry. For four of the novel variants, the minor allele frequency was low (<5%). In the trans-ethnic fine mapping of 47 BMI loci and 27 WHRadjBMI loci that were locus-wide significant (P < 0.05 adjusted for effective number of variants per locus) from the African ancestry sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses, 26 BMI loci and 17 WHRadjBMI loci contained ≤ 20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% posterior probability of driving the associations. The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants. Trans-ethnic meta-analyses further improved fine mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between the African and European ancestry populations.\nAuthor summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >300 genetic regions that influence body size and shape as measured by body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), respectively, but few have been identified in populations of African ancestry. We conducted large scale high coverage GWAS and replication of these traits in 52,895 and 23,095 individuals of African ancestry, respectively, followed by additional replication in European populations. We identified 10 genome-wide significant loci in all individuals, and an additional seven loci by analyzing men and women separately. We combined African and European ancestry GWAS and were able to narrow down 43 out of 74 African ancestry associated genetic regions to contain small number of putative causal variants. Our results highlight the improvement of applying high density genome coverage and combining multiple ancestries in the identification and refinement of location of genetic regions associated with adiposity traits.

Stage 1 included GWAS meta-analyses in AA individuals and stage 2 included replication of top associations from stage 1. Stage 3 included meta-analysis of top associations from stages 1 and 2 AA studies and EA meta-analysis results. In the discovery stage 1 of AAAGC, 17 GWAS of up to 42,752 AA individuals (16,559 men and 26,193 women; 41,696 African Americans and 1,056 Africans) were included for the BMI analyses. A total of 10 GWAS of up to 20,384 AA individuals (4,783 men and 15,601 women; all African Americans) were included for the WHRadjBMI analyses. For variants with P < 1×10−4 in either the sex-combined or the sex-stratified meta-analyses, stage 2 replication was performed in additional AA individuals from AAAGC (N = 10,143 for BMI, N = 2,711 for WHRadjBMI), followed by meta-analysis with EA individuals from the GIANT consortium (322,154 for BMI, 210,086 for WHRadjBMI). Variants that reached genome-wide significance (P < 5×10−8) were assessed for associations with BMI in two cohorts of children (N = 7,222). All AA participants in these studies provided written informed consent for the research, and approval for the study was obtained from the ethics review boards at all participating institutions. Detailed descriptions of each participating study and measurement and collection of height, weight, waist and hip circumferences are provided in S1 Text, S1 and S2 Tables.\n\nGenotyping, imputation and quality control\nGenotyping in each study was performed with Illumina or Affymetrix genome-wide SNP arrays. Pre-phasing and imputation of missing genotypes in each study was performed using MaCH/ minimac [20] or SHAPEIT2/IMPUTEv2 [21–22] using the 1000 Genomes Project cosmopolitan reference panel (Phase I Integrated Release Version 3, March 2012) [18]. The details of the array, genotyping and imputation quality-control procedures and sample exclusions for each study are listed in S3 Table. In general, samples reflecting duplicates, low call rates, gender mismatch, or population outliers were excluded. Variants were excluded by the following criteria: call rate < 0.95, minor allele count (MAC) ≤ 6, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) P < 1×10−4, imputation quality score < 0.3 for minimac or < 0.4 for IMPUTE, or absolute allele frequency difference > 0.3 compared with expected allele frequency (calculated as 1000 Genomes frequency of AFR × 0.8 + EUR × 0.2).\n\nPerformance of 1000 Genomes imputation in African ancestry\nWe evaluated the performance of 1000 Genomes imputation using the largest study, the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) (N = 8,054). A total of 25.1 million variants with MAF ≥ 0.1% were imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Of these, 98.1% (8.8 million) common variants, 95.4% (9.3 million) low frequency variants (0.5% ≤ MAF < 5%), and 72.5% (4.6 million) rare variants (0.1% ≤ MAF < 0.5%) were well imputed with IMPUTE info scores ≥ 0.3 (S4 Table). Notably, these frequencies are slightly lower than those obtained by imputation using 1000 Genomes phase 1 interim reference panel in Europeans [54]. However, 72.6%, 95.5% and 99.5% of the common, low frequency and rare variants, respectively, from the 1000 Genomes reference panel were not present in the HapMap and therefore demonstrate deeper coverage of the genome, particularly for the low frequency and rare variants.\n\nStudy-level association analyses\nAt all stages, genome-wide association analyses were performed by each of the participating studies. BMI was regressed on age, age squared, principal components and study site (if needed) to obtain residuals, separately by sex and case-control status, if needed. WHR was regressed on age, age squared, principal components, BMI and study site to obtain residuals, separately by sex and case-control status. Principal components were included to adjust for admixture proportion and population structure within each study. Residuals were inverse-normally transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of one. For studies with unrelated subjects, each variant was tested assuming an additive genetic model with each trait by regressing the transformed residuals on the number of copies of the variant effect allele. The analyses were stratified by sex and case-control status (if needed). For studies that included related individuals, family based association tests were conducted that took into consideration the genetic relationships among the individuals. Sex stratified, case-control stratified and combined analyses were performed. Association results with extreme values (absolute beta coefficient or standard error ≥ 10), primarily due to small sample sizes and/or low minor allele count, were excluded for meta-analysis.\n\nImputation of European GWAS summary statistics to 1000 Genomes\nThe latest summary statistics of sex-combined and sex-stratified meta-analyses of BMI and WHRadjBMI imputed to the HapMap reference panel in EA from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium were obtained from http://www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files [7–8]. These association summary statistics were used to impute z-scores of unobserved variants at the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel (Phase I Integrated Release Version 3) using the ImpG program [23]. In brief, palindromic variants (AT/CG) and variants with allele mismatch with the reference were removed from the data. Using the ImpG-Summary method, the z-score of an unobserved variant was calculated as a linear combination of observed z-scores weighted by the variance-covariance matrix between variants induced by LD within a 1 Mb window from the reference haplotypes. The sample size of each unobserved variant was also interpolated from the sample sizes of observed variants using the same weighting method for z-score as Ni=∑t=1t=T|wi,t|∑ |wi,t|Nt. Here, t = 1,2,….,T, where T is the number of observed variants, wi,t is the element of the covariance matrix Σi,t for the unobserved variant i and the observed variant t within window. The performance of imputation was assessed by r2pred, with similar characteristics as the standard imputation accuracy metric r2hat [20]. Results of variants with r2pred ≥ 0.6 were used in subsequent analyses.\n\nMeta-analysis\nIn the discovery stage 1, association results were combined across studies in sex-combined and sex-stratified samples using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis implemented in the program METAL [55]. The study-specific λ values of association ranged from 0.97 to 1.05 for BMI, and 0.98 to 1.05 for WHRadjBMI (S3 Table). Genomic control correction [56] was applied to each study before meta-analysis, and to the overall results after meta-analysis (λ = 1.07 for BMI, 1.01 for WHRadjBMI). Variants with results generated from < 50% of the total sample size for each trait were excluded. After filtering, the numbers of variants reported in the meta-analyses were 17,972,087 for BMI, and 20,502,658 for WHRadjBMI.\nVariants with P < 1×10−4 in stage 1 sex-combined or sex-stratified meta-analyses were carried forward for replication in additional AA individuals (stage 2) and EA individuals (stage 3). For each of the replication AA studies, trait transformation and association were performed as in stage 1 and results were meta-analyzed using the inverse-variance method in METAL. For the replication study in EA, HapMap imputed summary statistics of each trait from the GIANT consortium were used to impute z-scores of unobserved variants at the 1000 Genomes.\nIn stages 1 and 2, meta-analysis results of AA studies were combined using the inverse-variance weighted method. In all stages including both AA and EA studies, meta-analysis results expressed as signed z-scores were combined using the fixed effect sample size weighted method in METAL due to the lack of beta and standard error estimates from the ImpG program [23]. Evidence of heterogeneity of allelic effects between males and females, within and across stages were assessed by the I2 statistic in METAL. Genome-wide significance was declared at P < 5×10−8 from each of the sex-combined and sex-stratified meta-analysis including AA and/or combined AA and EA individuals. Difference in effects between men and women was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and nominal Phet < 0.05 declared as significant. A lead variant in a locus was defined as the most significant variant within a 1 Mb region. A novel locus was defined as a lead variant with distance > 500 kb from any established lead variants reported in previous studies. By convention, a locus was named by the closest gene(s) to the lead variant.\n\nConditional and joint analyses of summary statistics\nFor the genome-wide significant loci identified in sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses in AA (stages 1+2), we used the program GCTA [57–58] to select the top independent associated variants from summary statistics of the meta-analyses. This method uses the LD correlations between variants estimated from a reference sample to perform an approximate conditional association analysis. We used 8,054 unrelated individuals of African ancestry from the WHI cohort with ~15.7M variants available as the reference sample for LD estimation. To select the top independent variants in the discovery and replication meta-analysis results, we first selected all variants that had P < 5×10−8 and conducted analysis conditioning on the selected variants to search for the top variants iteratively via a stepwise model to select the independent variants from this list. Then we proceeded to condition the rest of the variants that had P > 5×10−8 on the list of independent variants in the same fashion until no variant had conditional P that passed the significance level P < 5×10−8. Finally, all the selected variants were fitted jointly in the model for effect size estimation.\nWe also tested if the genome-wide significant variants identified from sex-combined GWAS in AA and the locus-wide significant variants identified from sex-combined and sex-specific locus transferability studies in AA were independent from nearby established loci identified from EA studies [7–8]. First, the published lead variants from EA studies were used to search for all surrogate variants that were in high LD (r2>0.8 in 1000 Genomes Project EUR population). Second, these variants were pruned to select only variants in low LD in AA (r2<0.3 in the 1000 Genomes Project AFR population) to avoid collinearity in conditional analysis. Third, association analysis was conducted on the AA significant variants conditioned on the selected EA lead and surrogate variants, using the program GCTA and estimated LD correlation from the WHI cohort. For genome-wide significant loci, an AA derived association signal is considered as independent from the established EA signals when the difference in–logP <3 and difference in effect size < 1 standard error after conditional analysis. For locus-wide significant loci, given the lower level of significance, independence is only considered as difference in effect size < 1 standard error after conditional analysis.\n\nSNP and locus transferability analyses\nWe investigated the transferability of EA BMI and WHR associated variants and loci in AA individuals from stage 1 sex-combined and sex-stratified meta-analyses. First, we tested for replication of lead variants previously reported to be associated with BMI (176 variants from 170 loci) and WHRadjBMI (84 variants from 65 loci) at genome-wide significance in sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses from the GIANT consortium studies [7–9]. We defined SNP transferability as an EA lead variant sharing the same trait-raising allele at nominal P < 0.05 in AA individuals. To account for differences in local LD structure across populations, we also interrogated the flanking 0.1cM regions of the lead variants to search for the best variants with the smallest association P in AA individuals. Locus-wide significance was declared as Plocus < 0.05 by Bonferroni correction for the effective number of tests within a locus, estimated using the Li and Ji approach [59].\n\nFine mapping analyses\nWe compared the credible set intervals of established loci that showed locus-wide significance (Plocus < 0.05) in the sex-combined or sex-specific analyses from this study in summary statistics datasets including the 1000 Genomes imputed results from GIANT, AAAGC and meta-analysis of GIANT and AAAGC. In each dataset, a candidate region is defined as the flanking 0.1cM region of the lead variant reported by the GIANT consortium. Under the assumption of one causal variant in a region of M variants, the posterior probability of a variant j with association statistics Z driving the association, P(Cj|Z), was calculated using the formula P(Cj|Z)=exp(12⁡zj2)∑j=1Mexp(12zj2). A 99% credible set was constructed by ranking all variants by their posterior probability, followed by adding variants until the credible set has a cumulative posterior probability > 0.99 [53].\n\nBioinformatics\n\nFunctional annotation of novel variants\nTo determine whether any of our nine novel GWAS lead variants identified in the sex-combined and sex-specific analyses might be tagging potentially functional variants, we identified all variants within 1 Mb and in LD (r2 > 0.7, 1000 Genomes AFR) with our lead variants. As such, we identified 137 variants and annotated each of them using ANNOVAR [60]. The predicted functional impact for coding variants were assessed via the Exome Variant Server (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) for PhastCon, GERP [61], and PolyPhen [62], as well as SIFT [63].\nWe further characterized the variants that were in LD with the novel variants using the web-based tool RegulomeDB (http://regulomedb.org/) [24]. The variants that were likely to affect binding and linked to expression of a gene target (scores 1a-1f) based on “eQTL, transcription factor (TF) binding, matched TF motif, matched DNase footprint and DNase peak” or were only likely to affect binding (scores 2a-2c) based on “TF binding, matched TF motif, matched DNase footprint and DNase peak” were selected. For these variants, the sequence conservation (GERP and SiPhy [64]), the epigenomic data from the Roadmap Epigenomic project (ChromHMM states corresponding to enhancer or promoter elements, histone modification ChIP-seq peaks, and DNase hypersensitivity data peaks), the regulatory protein binding from the ENCODE project, the regulatory motifs based on commercial, literature and motif-finding analysis of the ENCODE project, and the eQTLs from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project [65] were extract from web-based HaploReg v4 [25]. For variants within the tractable credible sets in the fine mapping analyses, similar analyses were also conducted.\n\n\nCross-trait associations\nTo assess whether the novel loci identified in the sex-combined and sex-specific analyses were associated with any related cardiometabolic and anthropometric traits, or may be in high LD with known eQTLs, we examined the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog [27] and the GRASP (Genome-Wide Repository of Associations Between SNPs and Phenotypes) catalog [28] for reported variant-trait associations near our lead variants. We supplemented the catalogs with additional genome-wide significant associations of interest from the literature [7–9,66]. We used PLINK to identify variants within 1 Mb of lead variants. All variants within the specified regions with r2 > 0.7 (1000 Genomes AFR) were retained from the catalogs for further evaluation.\n\n\nPower analysis\nGiven our sample sizes in the discovery and replication stages in our African ancestry populations, we have >80% power to detect variants explaining 0.08% variance for BMI that corresponds to effect sizes of 0.09 and 0.20 SD units for MAF of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. For WHRadjBMI, we have >80% power to detect variants explaining 0.18% variance that corresponds to effect sizes of 0.14 and 0.30 SD units for MAF of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006719/title","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015967/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000458","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","abstract":["\nNanoparticles introduced in living cells are capable of strongly promoting the aggregation of peptides and proteins. We use here molecular dynamics simulations to characterise in detail the process by which nanoparticle surfaces catalyse the self-assembly of peptides into fibrillar structures. The simulation of a system of hundreds of peptides over the millisecond timescale enables us to show that the mechanism of aggregation involves a first phase in which small structurally disordered oligomers assemble onto the nanoparticle and a second phase in which they evolve into highly ordered  as their size increases.\nAuthor Summary: Protein misfolding and aggregation are associated with a wide variety of human disorders, which include Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and late onset diabetes. It has been recently realised that the process of aggregation may be triggered by the presence of nanoparticles. We use here molecular dynamics simulations to characterise the molecular mechanism by which such nanoparticles are capable of enhancing the rate of formation of peptide aggregates. Our findings indicate that nanoparticle surfaces act as a catalyst that increases the local concentration of peptides, thus facilitating their subsequent assembly into stable fibrillar structures. The approach that we present, in addition to providing a description of the process of aggregation of peptides in the presence of nanoparticles, will enable the study of the mechanism of action of a variety of other potential aggregation-promoting agents present in living organisms, including lipid membranes and other cellular components. "],"title":"A Condensation-Ordering Mechanism in Nanoparticle-Catalyzed Peptide Aggregation","materials_and_methods":["\nDescription of the model\nWe used a modified version of the tube model [42]. In this model, residues are represented by their  atoms, which are connected into a chain with a distance of 3.8±0.2 Å between neighbouring atoms. The tube geometry is approximated by assigning a diameter of 3.8 Å to the  atoms. Neighbouring  atoms are not allowed to interpenetrate. Bond angles are restricted between 82° to 148°, and an analogue of bending rigidity is introduced by means of an energetic penalty, , for values of bond angles lower than 107.15°; these are the same criteria used previously [42]. The introduction of  is useful to mimic the constraints placed on local conformations by the presence of side chains, as usually visualised by Ramachandran plot. Hydrophobicity enters through a pairwise-additive interaction energy of  (positive or negative) between any pair of residues  and  that approach closer than 7.5 Å.\nThe quasi-cylindrical symmetry of the tube is broken by the geometric requirements of hydrogen bonds. These geometrical requirements were deduced from an analysis of 500 high resolution PDB native structures [55], from which we computed the normalised histograms of distances between  atoms involved in backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds which are shown in Fig. 4. The distances we used to define the hydrogen bonds at the  atom level are summarised in Table 1. Our definitions distinguish between hydrogen bonds that belong to a  helix, parallel or anti-parallel  sheets. We emphasise the fact that there is not a full correspondence with the real hydrogen bonds formed between amide and carboxyl backbone groups. For instance, there are two different kinds of residue pairs facing each other in nearby anti-parallel . In the first kind, the two hydrogen bonds are formed between the two residues, whereas in the second kind, no hydrogen bond is formed between them. The two kinds alternate along the pair of nearby strands. In our definition of hydrogen bonds based on  atoms, we will say that for both kind of pairs one hydrogen bond is formed between the two . Yet, we keep track of the peculiar geometry of hydrogen bonds within anti-parallel  by using two different sets of distances, which we call anti-parallel 1 and anti-parallel 2, as the distances between consecutive  pairs facing each other on nearby  do indeed alternate. Furthermore, we request that one residue cannot form more than two hydrogen bonds, and that the first and last  atoms of a peptide do not at all. Hydrogen bonds may form cooperatively between residues  and  [or  and  for anti-parallel hydrogen bonds], thereby gaining an additional energy of . The distance criteria for cooperative hydrogen bonds within  are obtained from Fig. 4F and summarised in Table 1.\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000458.g004Figure 4\nNormalised histograms of distances between  atoms involved in backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds.\nThe analysis is based on 500 high resolution PDB structures [55] and used to define hydrogen bonds in the protein model employed in our simulation.

The hydrogen bonds are formally assigned to  atoms  (),  (parallel and anti-parallel ), and the cooperative hydrogen bonds are formed between the pairs  and  for parallel  or between the pairs  and  for anti-parallel .\nThe energy of hydrogen bonds was set to , where  is the thermal energy at room temperature and  is the Boltzmann constant. This energy correspond to the experimental one (1.5 kCal/mol at room temperature [56]). Values of the hydrophobicity and stiffness parameters,  and , are given in units of  and the reduced temperature is . In all our simulations we set  and . The ratio of a hydrogen bonding energy to hydrophobic energy is . As the number of hydrophobic contacts within an oligomer is usually about one order of magnitude larger than the number of hydrogen bonds, our choice ensures that these interactions provide similar contributions to the potential energy of the oligomer [47]. For this set of model parameter the peptide folds into a native  state below the folding temperature .  is the parameter which determines the strength of the interaction energy between  atoms representing the peptide molecules and the seed particle. The range of the peptide seed interaction is set to 10 Å from the nanoparticle surface.\n\nSimulation techniques\nWe performed discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations [57], which is a fast alternative to standard molecular dynamics simulations. The main difference is that in DMD simulations the system evolves on a collision by collision basis, and requires the calculation of the collision dynamics and the search for the next collision. In the simulations we used a cubic box, of side 633 Å, and applied periodic boundary conditions. The implementation of our definition for the hydrogen bonding requires some additional consideration. In order to prevent that one residue forms three hydrogen bonds we treat the associated collision as fully elastic. In order to implement and consider cooperative hydrogen bonding we keep and update a list of all hydrogen bonds formed in the system at all times. Note that a recalculation of the hydrogen bonds formed in the system without considering this list can lead to a different result. Independent starting configurations were generated at  and rapidly cooled down to  at the beginning of each simulation run. We performed all our simulation in the NVT ensemble using an Anderson thermostat.\nIn order to associate the number of collision steps performed in our simulation to a real time we measured the long time self-diffusion coefficient of our model peptide, , and matched it to experimental data. We took from the literature the value for the self-diffusion coefficient, , which was measured for lysozyme [43]. The Einstein relation for the diffusion coefficient together with the Stokes law yield  where  is the Boltzmann constant,  is the radius of the diffusing object, and  is the viscosity. The latter can be evaluated through kinetic theory as , where  is the density of the viscous medium in which diffusion takes place and  is the mean flight time between collision with solvent molecules setting the time scale [15].

This paper outlines a framework for characterizing the informational relationships generated by such systems. Qualia space (Q) is a space having an axis for each possible state (activity pattern) of a complex. Within Q, each submechanism specifies a point corresponding to a repertoire of system states. Arrows between repertoires in Q define informational relationships. Together, these arrows specify a quale—a shape that completely and univocally characterizes the quality of a conscious experience. Φ— the height of this shape—is the quantity of consciousness associated with the experience. Entanglement measures how irreducible informational relationships are to their component relationships, specifying concepts and modes. Several corollaries follow from these premises. The quale is determined by both the mechanism and state of the system. Thus, two different systems having identical activity patterns may generate different qualia. Conversely, the same quale may be generated by two systems that differ in both activity and connectivity. Both active and inactive elements specify a quale, but elements that are inactivated do not. Also, the activation of an element affects experience by changing the shape of the quale. The subdivision of experience into modalities and submodalities corresponds to subshapes in Q. In principle, different aspects of experience may be classified as different shapes in Q, and the similarity between experiences reduces to similarities between shapes. Finally, specific qualities, such as the “redness” of red, while generated by a local mechanism, cannot be reduced to it, but require considering the entire quale. Ultimately, the present framework may offer a principled way for translating qualitative properties of experience into mathematics.\nAuthor Summary: In prior work, we suggested that consciousness has to do with integrated information, which was defined as the amount of information generated by a system in a given state, above and beyond the information generated independently by its parts. In the present paper, we move from computing the quantity of integrated information to describing the structure or quality of the integrated information unfolded by interactions in the system. We take a geometric approach, introducing the notion of a quale as a shape that embodies the entire set of informational relationships generated by interactions in the system. The paper investigates how features of the quale relate to properties of the underlying system and also to basic features of experience, providing the beginnings of a mathematical dictionary relating neurophysiology to the geometry of the quale and the geometry to phenomenology.

Here, we report structural, biochemical and in vivo effects of substituting these glutamate residues. Unexpectedly, substitutions had little impact on ligand affinity or in vivo induction capabilities. Structures of QacR(E90Q) and QacR(E120Q) with ethidium or malachite green took similar global conformations that differed significantly from all previously described QacR-drug complexes but still prohibited binding to cognate DNA. Strikingly, the QacR(E90Q)-rhodamine 6G complex revealed two mutually exclusive rhodamine 6G binding sites. Despite multiple structural changes, all drug binding was essentially isoenergetic. Thus, these data strongly suggest that rather than contributing significantly to ligand binding affinity, the role of acidic residues lining the QacR multidrug-binding pocket is primarily to attract and guide cationic drugs to the “best available” positions within the pocket that elicit QacR induction.\n      "],"title":"A Single Acidic Residue Can Guide Binding Site Selection but Does Not Govern QacR Cationic-Drug Affinity","materials_and_methods":["\n        Bacterial strains and growth conditions\n        All cloning and over-expression procedures performed in Escherichia coli utilized strain DH5α and in Staphylococcus aureus strain RN4220 norA::erm (SAK1759) [24]. Strains were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth or agar containing, where appropriate, 100 µg/ml ampicillin for E. coli or 20 µg/ml erythromycin and 10 µg/ml chloramphenicol for S. aureus. E. coli was transformed by standard procedures [40] and S. aureus by electroporation as described previously [41], employing a pulse of 1.3 kV.\n      \n        DNA isolation and manipulations\n        The Quantum Prep plasmid miniprep kit (Bio-Rad) and small-scale alkaline lysis procedure [42] were employed to isolate plasmid DNA from E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, Pfu DNA polymerase, and Taq DNA polymerase (all from New England Biolabs), were each used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were purchased from GeneWorks (Australia) and Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, California). PCR products were purified with the Wizard PCR Prep kit (Promega) and DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the GFX PCR and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences).\n      \n        Construction of QacR mutants\n        QacR mutants E90A, E90Q, E120A and E120Q were obtained by generating a PCR-derived fragment encompassing the residue to be mutated and replacing the wt sequence as previously described [43]. The K67S substitution, which was found to aid in crystallization, was added to both of the E90Q and E120Q-substituted qacR genes using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The QacR K67S substitution elicited no observable change in affinity for R6G or IR1 DNA as measured by fluorescence polarization (data not shown). Similar to the C72A/C141S QacR derivative [9], the K67S substitution was thus considered to be a background substitution. Automated DNA sequencing, performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (Brisbane, Australia), was employed to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of spurious mutations that may have been introduced during PCR.\n      \n        Protein preparation\n        Mutant and wt QacR proteins were over-expressed from E. coli cells carrying plasmid derivatives of pSK5676, purified by Ni2+-NTA metal chelate affinity chromatography (Invitrogen ProBond resin) as previously described [44], and dialysed against buffer A (1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, pH 7.5) for tryptophan fluorescence quenching or buffer B (100 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5% [v/v] glycerol, pH 7.5) for ITC.\n      \n        Ligand binding affinity\n        Tryptophan fluorescence intensity measurements of QacR proteins were performed and Kd values calculated as described previously [44]. Each of the reported Kd values represents an average of three separate Kd determinations. Affinity of QacR proteins for Dq was measured using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) using protocols as described previously [30].\n      \n        Stoichiometry determination\n        Stoichiometry of QacR(E90Q)-R6G binding was determined by fluorescence polarization using a Beacon 2000 (Invitrogen) fluorescence polarimeter and excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 560 nm, respectively. R6G was dissolved in buffer B to a final concentration of 1.0 mM and QacR(E90Q) was titrated into the solution up to a final concentration of 5.0 mM.\n      \n        Protein stability\n        QacR protein was detected in whole cell lysates of S. aureus SAK1759 containing the desired plasmid using a rabbit polyclonal QacR antibody [9] as previously described [43].\n      \n        β-lactamase reporter gene assays\n        β-lactamase activities of S. aureus SAK1759 cells containing the plasmid of interest, were determined using the chromogenic substrate nitrocefin (Oxoid) as described previously [43], [45] and are presented such that 1 unit corresponds to 1 µM nitrocefin hydrolyzed/min at 37°C. Results represent the average of two experiments.\n      \n        Crystallization, data collection and structure determination of mutant QacR-drug complexes\n        Purified QacR mutant proteins were subjected to reductive alkylation of lysines [3], [46], concentrated to 10 mg/ml and buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The resulting protein preparations were incubated with 50–500 µM Et, Dq, MG, or R6G. Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method, with each QacR-drug complex mixed 1∶1 with the crystallization solution of 2.3-2.7 M ammonium sulphate and 50–150 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6.\n        X-ray intensity data from the QacR(E120Q)-R6G, QacR(E120Q)-Dq, QacR(E90Q)-R6G and QacR(E90Q)-Et complex crystals were collected using ALS beam line (BL) 4.2.2; QacR(E90Q)-MG, QacR(E90Q)-Et complex crystals at ALS BL 8.2.2 and the QacR(E90Q)-Dq data at ALS BL 8.2.1 at 100K. Data were processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA [47], [48]. QacR(E90Q) and QacR(E120Q) in complex with R6G and Dq crystallized in the native P42212 space group whereas crystals of QacR(E90Q) and QacR(E120Q) in complex with Et and MG took the hexagonal space group P62. The structures were solved using MOLREP and the wt QacR structure as a search model (minus solvent and residue 90 or 120) and refined with Refmac5, as implemented in CCP4 [47]. The programs O and Coot were used to visualize and manipulate experimental electron density maps and structures for model building [49], [50]. The stereochemistry of each structure was validated by MolProbity [51] and PROCHECK [52]; PROCHECK was also used for Ramachandran analysis. Table S1 lists selected data collection and refinement statistics for each of the complexes.\n        Figures 1-4 were prepared with Chimera [53] and Figures S6–S8 were generated in Pymol [54]. Structural alignments were performed in O using the least-squared fitting function (LSQ-EXP/MOL) [50]. The center-to-center distances of the recognition helices (α3) were measured by averaging the positions of the Cα atoms of the residues 37–40 in the middle of each recognition helix and the distance between each of these helical centers determined by the Pythagorean distance formula. Conformational changes were measured with DymDom [55].\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028393/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003562","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Introduction: Breast feeding has long term effects on the developing immune system which outlive passive immunization of the neonate. We have investigated the transfer of milk immune cells and examined the result of transfer once the recipients were adult. Methods: Non-transgenic mouse pups were foster-nursed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic dams for 3 weeks and the fate of GFP+ cells was followed by FACS analysis, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for GFP and appropriate immune cell markers. Pups suckled by non-transgenic dams served as controls. Results: Despite a preponderance of B cells and macrophages in the stomach contents of the pups, most cells undergoing trans-epithelial migration derived from the 3–4% of milk cells positive for T lymphocyte markers. These cells homed to the spleen and thymus, with maximal accumulation at 3–4 weeks. By sensitizing dams with an antigen which elicits a T cell-mediated delayed-type-hypersensitivity (DTH) response, we determined that nursing by a sensitized dam (compared to a non-sensitized dam) amplified a subsequent DTH response in females and yet suppressed one in males. Discussion: These results suggest that clinical evaluation weighing the pros and cons of nursing male versus female children by mothers with genetically-linked hypersensitivity diseases, such as celiac disease and eczema, or those in regions of the world with endemic DTH-eliciting diseases, such as tuberculosis, may be warranted.

The GFPtg mice express GFP in all tissues, with B and T cells expressing higher levels. In addition, levels of GFP expression are uniform from cell to cell within a particular lineage, changing little during development [17]. Animals were housed in cages with controlled temperature and humidity and alternating 12-h light and dark cycles. The facilities were normal, non-SPF (specific pathogen-free), non-barrier facilities approved by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animals were used in accordance with current United States Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and National Institutes of Health Regulations. Commercial, non-sterile diet and water were given ad libitum.\n\nFostering of Pups\nMice were coordinately mated and wildtype B6 pups were fostered by GFPtg dams. The snouts of the dams were painted with vanilla extract prior to exchanging pups to prevent pup rejection. Organs from fostered pups were collected at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of nursing and one week post weaning (week 4) for RT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining, and flow cytometry. Additionally, fostered pups were allowed to age to 4 months and were themselves mated with each other to examine lactating mammary glands from fostered females as well as small intestines from the resulting pups.\n\nRNA Extraction\nOrgans (spleen, small intestine, thymus, liver, large intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, ileum with Peyer's patches, mammary glands, and lung) were collected from fostered pups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and 4 months of age and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For intestinal samples, the lumen was thoroughly flushed with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen to ensure removal of any unincorporated maternal cells. Samples were pulverized using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated from the samples using Tri Reagent (Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\nRT-PCR Analysis\nRNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically and equal amounts of total RNA (5 µg) were reverse transcribed using Oligo(dT)12–18 Primer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37°C. Primers for GFP, Oct-4, β-Casein, or GAPDH were used for PCR amplification using the AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase System (Invitrogen). Thirty cycles of PCR were used for GFP using the primers 5′ GCC-GAC-AAG-CAG-AAG-AAC-G 3′ (forward) and 5′ TCC-AGC-AGG-ACC-ATG-TGA-T 3′ (reverse), for Oct-4 using the primers 5′ GGG-ATG-GCA-TAC-TGT-GGA 3′ (forward) and 5′ AGC-TTG-GCA-AAC-TGT-TCT-AG 3′ (reverse), and for β-Casein using the primers 5′ ATC-CTC-GCC-TGC-CTT-GT 3′ (forward) and 5′ TGT-GGG-ACG-GGA-TTG-C 3′ (reverse) and 26 cycles for GAPDH using the primers 5′ CCT-TCC-GTG-TTC-CTA-CCC 3′ (forward) and 5′ GGT-CCA-GGG-TTT-CTT-ACT-CC 3′(reverse) at 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C (54°C for β-casein) for 30 sec, 68°C for 30 sec, followed by extension at 72°C for 7 min. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, from at least 3 different fosters, and each repetition gave similar results.\n\nImmunofluorescent Staining\nOrgans were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in DPBS for 2 h at room temperature. Organs were then transferred into 30% sucrose in DPBS and kept at 4°C overnight before freezing in Tissue Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Twenty micron sections were made and post-fixed in acetone and blocked with 5% FBS, rabbit IgG (1∶1000 dilution; Sigma), and mouse IgG, Fc Fragment (1∶1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.; Westgrove, PA, USA) in DPBS. For CD4, CD8, B220, and F4/80 staining, 5% rat serum was also added to the blocking solution. For macrophage staining using tomato lectin, 0.1% Triton-X 100 was added to the blocking solution. Sections were then stained with Alexa-conjugated (1∶1000 dilution; Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR, USA) rabbit anti-GFP, and purified rat anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody (1∶50 dilution; Clone H129.19; BD Pharmingen; San Diego, CA, USA), purified rat anti-mouse CD8a monoclonal antibody (1∶50 dilution; Clone 53-6.7; BD Pharmingen), purified hamster anti-mouse TCR γδ monoclonal antibody (1∶10 dilution; Clone GL3; BD Pharmingen), purified rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 monoclonal antibody (1∶50 dilution; Clone RA3-6B2; BD Pharmingen), biotinylated-lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin (1∶100 dilution; Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA), or biotin anti-mouse F4/80 antigen antibody (1∶800 dilution; eBioscience; San Diego, CA, USA). For the purified hamster anti-mouse TCR γδ monoclonal antibody a secondary biotin anti-hamster cocktail (1∶100 dilution; BD Pharmingen) was used. For the purified rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220, CD8a, and CD4 antibodies, secondary biotin polyclonal anti-rat Igs (1∶50 dilution; BD Pharmingen) were used. The antibodies were visualized using Streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores (1∶500 dilution; BD Pharmingen or Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and analyzed using the Pathway HT Confocal Microscope (BD Biosciences; Rockville, MD, USA). At least 3 different fostering experiments were performed and immunofluorescent staining of slides was conducted on tissue sections from 6 different animals. For each animal, two 20 µm sections were examined and 6 fields approximated as representative of the whole section, were visualized by confocal microscopy at 1000× magnification. Positively stained cells per field were counted and percentages were calculated.\n\nFlow Cytometry\nCoagulated milk from GFPtg dams was obtained from the stomach of fostered pups. This was then pressed through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences; Bedford, MA, USA). Cells were washed with DPBS twice to remove milk solids and lipids. Spleen and thymus were made into a single cell suspension by pressing the organ through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). For spleens, red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma). Cells were counted and Fc receptors were blocked using mouse IgG, Fc Fragment (1 µg/100 µL; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.; Westgrove, PA, USA). Cells were then surface stained with Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8a monoclonal antibody (0.125 µg/50 µL; Clone 53-6.7; eBioscience), Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody (0.125 µg/50 µL; Clone RM4-5; eBioscience) and Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated hamster anti-mouse γδ T cell receptor monoclonal antibody (0.25 µg/50 µL; Clone GL3; BD Pharmingen). Additionally, milk cells were stained with Pacific Blue-conjugated rat anti-mouse B220 antibody (0.5 µg/50 µL; Clone RA3-6B2; eBioscience), APC-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD3e monoclonal antibody (0.125 µg/50 µL; Clone 145-2C11; BD Pharmingen), and Biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (0.125 µg/50 µL; Clone BM8; eBioscience). The secondary antibody Streptavidin-PE (0.125 µg/50 µL; BD Pharmingen) was used for F4/80 staining. Cells were stained intracellularly with anti-GFP, rabbit IgG fraction, Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (0.125 µg/50 µL; Molecular Probes) and Pacific Blue rat anti-mouse/rat Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3; 0.5 µg/50 µL; Clone FJK-16s; eBioscience). Prior to intracellular staining, cells were first treated with the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Pharmingen) as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (5% FBS in PBS) prior to analysis. Cells were analyzed using the FACSAria Cell Sorting System (BD Biosciences) and FACS Diva Software (BD Biosciences). Wildtype B6 and GFPtg control spleens were used as compensation controls. Cells from wildtype B6 organs were used as background staining controls and this background fluorescence was subtracted from all samples. Staining results for spleen and thymus presented are the average of at least 8 different samples from at least 4 different fosters. In each case, >30,000 events were recorded. Staining of milk cells is the average of 11 different samples.\n\nEffect of maternal sensitization on foster pup Delayed Type Hypersensitivity\nFemale GFPtg mice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of fixed Candida albicans into both flanks at least 5 days prior to being coordinately mated. B6 pups were then foster nursed by either sensitized or non-sensitized GFPtg dams. When the foster nursed pups reached the age of 8 weeks, they were challenged with Candida albicans protein antigen (Alercheck, Inc., Portland, ME, USA) in the footpad. In a second set of experiments conducted with the same dams (3 months post-sensitization at time of fostering), 8 week old foster-nursed pups (6–10 per group, each group derived from 3 different dams) were sensitized with an intradermal injection of fixed Candida albicans into both flanks and then received a second injection (challenge) 7 days later with Candida albicans protein antigen in the footpad. Footpads were measured prior to the second exposure and 24 hours post-challenge (peak footpad swelling) using a micrometer (Mitutoyo, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nStatistical analyses\nFor delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) experiments, statistical significance was determined by the Mann Whitney test. For all other experiments, statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student's t test with corrections for multiple comparisons against a single control group, where appropriate. Data are expressed as means±SEM and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003562/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003562/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003562/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003562/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176848/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nCollective behavior has recently attracted a great deal of interest in both natural and social sciences. While the role of leadership has been closely scrutinized, the rules used by joiners in collective decision making have received far less attention. Two main hypotheses have been proposed concerning these rules: mimetism and quorum. Mimetism predicts that individuals are increasingly likely to join collective behavior as the number of participants increases. It can be further divided into selective mimetism, where relationships among the participants affect the process, and anonymous mimetism, where no such effect exists. Quorum predicts that a collective behavior occurs when the number of participants reaches a threshold. To probe into which rule is used in collective decision making, we conducted a study on the joining process in a group of free-ranging Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) in Huangshan, China using a combination of all-occurrence and focal animal sampling methods. Our results show that the earlier individuals joined movements, the more central a role they occupied among the joining network. We also found that when less than three adults participated in the first five minutes of the joining process, no entire group movement occurred subsequently. When the number of these early joiners ranged from three to six, selective mimetism was used. This means higher rank or closer social affiliation of early joiners could be among the factors of deciding whether to participate in movements by group members. When the number of early joiners reached or exceeded seven, which was the simple majority of the group studied, entire group movement always occurred, meaning that the quorum rule was used. Putting together, Macaca thibetana used a combination of selective mimetism and quorum, and early joiners played a key role in deciding which rule should be used.\n"],"title":"Collective Movement in the Tibetan Macaques (Macaca thibetana): Early Joiners Write the Rule of the Game","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nThis study complies with the regulations of the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association regarding the ethical treatment of research subjects, and under the law of People’s Republic of China on the protection of wildlife. The study was fully observational, and our data collection did not affect the monkeys’ welfare. Huangshan Monkey Management Center and the Huangshan Garden Forest Bureau permitted us to conduct research at the field site.\n\nStudy Site and Subjects\nThe study was conducted from August to December of 2012 at Mt. Huangshan National Reserve located in Anhui province, China. The reserve is a UNESCO World Culture and Nature Heritage site as well as a well-known tourist destination [39]. The study site is publicly owned. Similar to other macaques, Tibetan macaques display linear dominance hierarchies [37].\nThe group of Tibetan macaques in our field study was known as Yulinkeng 1 (YA1), which had been continually observed since 1986. At the time of our research, the troop constituted a total of 32 members including four adult males, eight adult females, six sub-adults, nine juveniles, and five infants. YA1 inhabits an area within the reserve known as the “Valley of the Wild Monkeys” (N30° 04’ 25.1” / E118° 08’ 59.3”) [40]. This area is characterized by steep, mountainous terrain. The group of monkeys were wild. They engaged in social activities in nearby forest during most of the day without any restriction on their home range. For the convenience of viewing by tourists, they were supplied with 3–4 kilograms of corn daily [39–41]. After corn feeding, they regularly switched locations from the feeding site to forest. Collective movements often occurred at the time of the switch.\nOur focal animals were the 12 adults of YA1, which had been habituated to human presence. They were individually recognized based on distinctive physical features such as scars, hair color patterns, or facial/body appearances [36,39]. Prior studies have provided detailed information about individual identities and life histories for all the members [40].

Their ages were estimated based on physical features [36].\n\n\n\nDefinitions and Behavioral Observations\nWe observed the focal group seven hours per day from 08:30 to 11:30 and from 13:30 to 17:30. We recorded collective movements via a digital video camera (Canon EOS 550D). Based on our preliminary observation for YA1 (August 1st-14th, 2012), we used a set of criteria similar to those used by Sueur and Petit [16] for collecting data about collective movements so that our results are comparable with existing macaque literature. The following are operational definitions for the key terms used in our study.\n\nInitiation: starting when the first adult walks more than 10 meters in less than 30 seconds. This criterion allowed us to discriminate between the initiation of a collective movement and other movements such as feeding movements. Sub-adults, juveniles, and infants were excluded from initiators because they never incited any entire group movement during our preliminary observation.\nJoiner: any individual that walks more than five meters within 45° in the direction to which the initiator departs before the joining is terminated [16]. A joiner that moves in the first five minutes after the initiator departs is defined as an early joiner. For the convenience of presentation, initiators were also counted as earlier joiners. The criterion of five minutes is the minimum duration that can result in an entire group movement based on our preliminary observation. In our data analyses, an initiator was also considered as an early joiner because, by definition, it participated in movements within the first five minutes. More importantly, this broader definition allowed us to focus on the role of all early joiners in collective movements. Since our study focused on adults, early joiners referred exclusively to adults accordingly.\nTermination of joining: when no more individual joins the movement within five minutes after the departure of the first individual or after the joining of the last individual [16]. That is, the joining process is considered finished when the delay of the next individual joining the movement exceeds five minutes.\nEntire group movement: a collective movement that has at least two-thirds of all the group members joining the movement before termination. During the mating season, we observed 171 entire group movements initiated by 12 adult members. The duration of an entire group movement was 9.60±3.53 (mean ± SD) minutes.\n\nThe feeding site was marked with a systematic grid of reference points and divided into four zones (Fig 1). This allowed us to accurately record the positions and movement distances for each animal. The starting zone refers to the area in feeding site where less than or equal to 10 meters from the starting point of initiator [16]. We included movement events only if at least two-thirds of the group members were present in the starting zone when they occurred [32].\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0127459.g001\nFig 1\n\nDiagram of feeding site for group YA1.\n\n\n\nMeasurements during collective movements were taken using the all occurrence sampling method [42].\n\nData Analyses\nTo quantify how often two early joiners occur together in collective movements, we used the half-weight index (HWI) [43] calculated by the number of two individuals seen together divided by the total number of movements. Its value ranges between 0 (never associated) and 1 (always associated) [11]. We drew the topology of co-occurrence for early joiners during movements via Netdraw in UCINET 6.0 [44].\nWe calculated eigenvector centrality coefficient via HWI matrices using SOCPROG 2.4 [45–49]. Eigenvector centrality coefficient measures how closely associated an individual is to others in collective movements. A high value means either that the individual is connected to more group members than otherwise or that the individual is connected to others that are also highly central in collective movements [46]. Based on eigenvector centrality coefficient, we quantified the attraction of every early joiner to others during joining processes.\nTo affirm the importance of early joiners on the joining process, we analyzed the correlation between the joining position of every joiner and its centrality coefficient. The joining order index was calculated for each individual per group movement with the following formula: 1－[I－1/N－1], where I is the position in the order of group progression taken by the individual, and N is the number of group members [50]. The index ranges from 1 (= first position) to 0 (= last position). We scored each individual's mean joining order index using this formula.\nTo evaluate whether affiliative relationship influences the joining process in collective movements, we correlated the co-occurrence of early joiners in collective movements with that in other daily group activities measured by proximity. To do so, we calculated the eigenvector centrality coefficients based on HWI and the dyadic association index (DAI). DAI measures how frequently two individuals X and Y are associated during their daily group activities except collective movements [51]: Dab/(Da+Db-Dab), where Dab refers to the duration in which X and Y are seen within one meter of each other, Da refers to the duration when X is seen, and Db refers to the duration when Y is seen. The DAI centrality coefficient quantifies the attraction of an individual to other group members during group activities other than collective movements.\nTo obtain durations data for calculating DAI, we used focal animal sampling and continuous recording via a digital voice recorder [42]. We used 10 minutes as the duration of each focal sample so that all adults could be sampled at least once a day (Table 1) [52].\nTo assess the effect of early joiners’ social ranks on the joining process, we determined the dominance ranks of the 12 adults by aggressive and submissive interactions using the event behavior sampling method [37,42,52]. Aggressive interactions were scored when one individual stared, hit, chased, or scratched another individual [36]. Submissive interactions include such behaviors as fearful grin, cower, mock leave, avoid, flee, or scream during social interactions [37]. We considered an individual in a lower rank if it displayed submissive behavior toward another group member. On the contrary, the individual to which a lower ranking member submitted was considered in a higher rank [36,52].\n\nStatistical Analyses\nTo analyze the effect of sex on the joining process and to evaluate the attraction differences of early joiners in the social network, we used independent-samples t test for situations involving two samples and K-independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test for situations involving three or more samples. To test the effect of age and rank on the joining process, the relationship between the joining order of a joiner and its centrality coefficient, and to examine the effect of social affiliation on the joining process, we used Spearman rank correlation analysis. Since t test is parametric, we used one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assure that the normality assumption of sample distribution was not violated. All tests were conducted using SPSS (version 13.0), and the level of significance was set at 0.05 a priori.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127459/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) forms stable ternary complexes in which RT is bound tightly at fixed positions on the primer-template (P/T). We have probed downstream interactions between RT and the template strand in the complex containing the incoming dNTP (+1 dNTP•RT•P/T complex) and in the complex containing the pyrophosphate analog, foscarnet (foscarnet•RT•P/T complex). Methods and Results: UV-induced cross-linking between RT and the DNA template strand was most efficient when a bromodeoxyuridine residue was placed in the +2 position (the first template position downstream from the incoming dNTP). Furthermore, formation of the +1 dNTP•RT•P/T complex on a biotin-containing template inhibited binding of streptavidin when biotin was in the +2 position on the template but not when the biotin was in the +3 position. Streptavidin pre-bound to a biotin residue in the template caused RT to stall two to three nucleotides upstream from the biotin residue. The downstream border of the complex formed by the stalled RT was mapped by digestion with exonuclease RecJF. UV-induced cross-linking of the complex formed by the pyrophosphate analog, foscarnet, with RT and P/T occurred preferentially with bromodeoxyuridine in the +1 position on the template in keeping with the location of RT one base upstream in the foscarnet•RT•P/T complex (i.e., in the pre-translocation position). Conclusions: For +1 dNTP•RT•P/T and foscarnet•RT•P/T stable complexes, tight interactions were observed between RT and the first unpaired template nucleotide following the bound dNTP or the primer terminus, respectively.

Other synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys and gel-purified prior to use. Unlabeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs), dNTPs and ATP were purchased from GE Healthcare. Unlabeled dNTPs were pretreated with thermostable pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science) as previously described [19]. [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]ddATP were from GE Healthcare. [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]dTTP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. BrdUTP was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or from TriLink BioTechnologies. Oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP, or 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]ddATP and terminal transferase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) as described by the supplier. Internal labeling of BrdU-containing templates with [α-32P]dCTP is described below. Unlabeled 5′-phosphorylated oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared with T4 polynucleotide kinase and unlabeled ATP.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003561.g001Figure 1\nDNA primer-templates.\n(A) Primer-templates used for photo-cross-linking studies. “B” indicates a BrdU residue and * shows the position of an α-32P-labeled dC residue in the template.

Incubation was for 30 min at 37°C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.\nTo prepare the chain-terminated primers L35-ddA and L36-ddA shown in Figure 1B the unterminated oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end labeled, annealed with a 4-fold excess of WL50-Bio39 in 40 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl by heating at 90°C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature, and chain-terminated by incubating with 200 nM HIV-1 RT in RB buffer (40 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol) containing 0.08 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 µM of the next complementary ddNTP for 30 min at 37°C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. L37-ddG was prepared from L36 by annealing to WL50-Bio39 and extending with dATP and ddGTP. The size of the extended product was confirmed by electrophoresis.\n\nReverse Transcriptase\nHis-tagged wild type HIV-1 RT was expressed from pKRT2, provided by R. D'Aquila and W.C. Summers [20] through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, and modified to add an N-terminal polyhistidine tag as previously described [21]. The RT coding sequence was derived from the BH10 clone of HIV-1 [20], expressed in JM109 E. coli, and purified by metal affinity chromatography (His-Bind Resin, Novagen). Specific activity was 20,000 to 23,000 units/mg where one unit corresponds to the amount of enzyme needed for incorporation of 1.0 nmole [3H]dTMP in 10 min at 37°C using poly(rA)/oligo(dT) as substrate [22]. This construct was expressed as p66/p66 homodimer but proteolytic cleavage of one of the p66 subunits by unidentified protease activity during purification or storage produced polypeptide about 51 kDa [23]. The p66 to p51 ratio, determined by quantifying the intensity of Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain after fractionation of the subunits on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, indicated the presence of about 74% heterodimer and 26% homodimer RT in these experiments. The experiment in Figure 2A was also repeated with commercial p66/p51 heterodimer RT strain HXB2 lacking the polyhistidine tag (Worthington Biochemical Corp).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003561.g002Figure 2\nPhoto-cross-linking of HIV-1 RT to template containing two adjacent BrdU residues.\n(A) Stable complexes were formed by incubating 40 nM HIV-1 RT, 9 nM P/T (the indicated primer annealed to CBB template (Figure 1)), and 100 µM of the +1 dNTP (+1 complex); or 200 nM HIV-1 RT, 9 nM P/T, and 3.2 mM foscarnet (PFA complex) for 10 min at 37°C followed by cooling in ice. Heparin was added and the mixture was kept in ice and exposed to UV light as described in the text. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Positions of MW markers are indicated at the left of each panel.

The experiment in (A) was repeated with heterodimer RT obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. with similar results.\n\nPreparation of Internally 32P-Labeled, BrdU-Containing Templates\nLabeled BrdU-containing templates were prepared essentially as described by Coman et al. [24]. To prepare CBB or CTT template (Figure 1A) 100 pmoles of oligodeoxynucleotide XT20 (5′-TGCGACCGAGAGCAGAGGGC-3′) were annealed with 400 pmoles of a scaffold oligodeoxynucleotide XL69 (5′-GTGTGTGTGTGTCTACTAGTTTTCTCCATCTAGACGATACCAGCGTGAAGCCCTCTGCTCTCGGTCGCA-3′) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and extended with Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA polymerase (USB Corp.). Sequenase Version 2.0 (consisting of exonuclease-deficient T7 gene 5 protein and E. coli thioredoxin) was preincubated at a concentration of 2 units/µl in 6.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3.0 mM potassium phosphate, 6.4 mM DTT, 0.08 mM EDTA, and 7.5% glycerol for 20 min on ice. XT20 extension was carried out in a volume of 200 µl with 3–7 units of Sequenase, 90 µM BrdUTP (for synthesis of CBB template) or 50 µM dTTP (for synthesis of CTT template), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 1 mM DTT at 37°C for 45 min followed by addition of 40 µCi [α-32P]dCTP and further incubation at 37°C for 30 min. Then 1 mM of unlabeled dCTP was added and incubation continued for 20 min. The sample was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 132 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 40 mM KCl, and annealed with 160 pmoles 5′ phosphorylated XT34 oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-ACGCTGGTATCGTCTAGATGGAGAAAACTAGTAG-3′). Ligation was carried out for 1-2 h at 25°C in a total volume of 50 µl containing 113 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 36 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 3% PEG 6000, and 2.5 µl (5000 units) of Quick T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The sample was fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide in 7 M urea and the 57-nucleotide ligation product was recovered by excision, eluted by soaking overnight in 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0, and recovered by ethanol precipitation.\nTemplate CBT was prepared as described above except that XT21 (5′-TGCGACCGAGAGCAGAGGGCT-3′) was annealed with XL69 and extended with BrdUTP and [α-32P]dCTP followed by ligation with 5′-phosphorylated XT34. Template CTB was prepared by annealing synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide XT20BT (5′-TGCGACCGAGAGCAGAGGGC[BrdU]T-3′) with XL69, extending with [α-32P]dCTP and ligating with 5′-phosphorylated XT34.\n\nPhoto-Cross-Linking Reactions\nCBB, CTT, CTB or CBT template was annealed with a 4-fold excess of each of the eight chain-terminated primers shown in Figure 1A and 5 to 20 nM P/T was incubated with 4 to 80-fold excess of HIV-1 RT, without or with 100 µM dNTP or with 3.2 mM foscarnet, in 10 µl RB buffer for 5–10 min at 37°C, then cooled in ice for 5 min. P/T and RT concentrations are given in the figure legends. Foscarnet was purchased as 80 mM Foscavir intravenous solution from AstraZeneca. The reaction mixture was transferred to an ice-cold 96-well Costar brand UV transparent plate (Corning, Inc., Life Sciences) containing heparin solution (final concentration 2.3 mU/ml) and exposed to 1 Joule UV light from a GS Gene Linker (BioRad Labs.) Samples were heated (4 min at 90°C) in the presence of 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 10% sucrose, and 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.\n\nElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) for dNTP-Induced Stable Complex Formation and for Detection of Streptavidin (SA) Bound to Biotin-Containing DNA\nEMSA assay for heparin-resistant stable complex formation on the 5 nM 5′-labeled chain-terminated primers annealed to biotin-containing WL50-Bio39 template (Figure 1B) was carried out as previously described [8] except that HIV-1 RT concentration was 100 nM. Additional EMSA assays were carried out to determine if prior binding of dNTP could prevent the binding of SA (Sigma Aldrich) to the template biotin residue [25]. After 10 min incubation at 37°C with dNTP, the reaction mixtures were cooled on ice for 5 min and SA was added to a final concentration of 50 to 250 nM and incubated at 37°C for 2–5 min. Then free biotin (Sigma Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 0.6 to 6.0 µM as indicated and the incubation was continued at 37°C for 5 min to trap excess SA. RT was dissociated by addition of an equal volume of loading dye-urea-TTE (16 M urea, 180 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 60 mM taurine, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol) with 0.5% SDS prior to electrophoresis. These conditions dissociate RT from the P/T but do not dissociate SA bound to the biotin residue in the template. SA-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris-taurine buffer (90 mM Tris, 30 mM taurine, pH 7.5).\n\nPrimer Extension\nFive nM 5′-32P-labeled L32 primer or L20 primer annealed with WL50-Bio39 template was incubated without or with 100 nM SA in RB buffer and 0.08 mg/ml BSA at 37°C for 2-3 min. Then HIV-1 RT (200 nM) was added with 100 µM each of the four dNTPs and 6 µM free biotin, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 to 45 min to allow primer extension. An equal volume of loading dye-urea-TTE was added and products were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\n\nDetection of Barriers to RecJF Exonuclease Digestion\nWL50-Bio39 template was 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]ddATP and terminal transferase and annealed to unlabeled L32 primer. Five nM P/T was incubated with 50 nM SA in RB buffer and 0.08 mg/ml BSA at 37°C for 5 min, and cooled in ice. An aliquot was taken for digestion with RecJF exonuclease (New England Biolabs, Inc.) at 1 U per µl of reaction mixture and incubated at 37°C, sampling at various times as previously described [8]. HIV-1 RT (12.5 nM) and 100 µM each of the four dNTPs was added to an additional aliquot and incubated for 10 min at 37°C, followed by addition of RecJF and additional incubation as indicated above. Incubation was terminated by addition of an equal volume of loading dye-urea-TTE and electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003561/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nFrancisella tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 select agent by the CDC due to its low infectious dose and the possibility that the organism can be used as a bioweapon. The low dose of infection suggests that Francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses. Although ~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood. To provide additional insights into these interactions during early Francisella infection of mice, we performed TEM analysis on mouse lungs infected with F. tularensis strains Schu S4, LVS and the O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn. For all three strains, the majority of the bacteria that we could detect were observed within alveolar type II epithelial cells at 16 hours post infection. Although there were no detectable differences in the amount of bacteria within an infected cell between the three strains, there was a significant increase in the amount of cellular debris observed in the air spaces of the lungs in the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant compared to either the Schu S4 or LVS strain. We also studied the interactions of Francisella strains with human AT-II cells in vitro by characterizing the ability of these three strains to invade and replicate within these cells. Gentamicin assay and confocal microscopy both confirmed that F. tularensis Schu S4 replicated robustly within these cells while F. tularensis LVS displayed significantly lower levels of growth over 24 hours, although the strain was able to enter these cells at about the same level as Schu S4 (1 organism per cell), as determined by confocal imaging. The Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant that we have previously described as attenuated for growth in macrophages and mouse virulence displayed interesting properties as well. This mutant induced significant airway inflammation (cell debris) and had an attenuated growth phenotype in the human AT-II cells. These data extend our understanding of early Francisella infection by demonstrating that Francisella enter significant numbers of AT-II cells within the lung and that the capsule and LPS of wild type Schu S4 helps prevent murine lung damage during infection. Furthermore, our data identified that human AT-II cells allow growth of Schu S4, but these same cells supported poor growth of the attenuated LVS strain in vitro. Collectively, these data further our understanding of the role of AT-II cells in Francisella infections.\n"],"title":"Interactions of Francisella tularensis with Alveolar Type II Epithelial Cells and the Murine Respiratory Epithelium","materials_and_methods":["\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nF. tularensis LVS, F. tularensis Schu S4 and the F. tularensis waaY::TrgTn (FTT1236) mutant in the Schu S4 background were routinely cultured on modified Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Acumedia) or in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 1% glucose (wt/vol) 0.025% ferric pyrophosphate and 2% IsoVitaleX [24]. In preparation for experiments, strains were grown in modified Mueller-Hinton broth with aeration at 37°C. The antibiotics kanamycin and/or spectinomycin were added to the growth media at a concentration of 25 μg per ml when necessary.\n\nEpithelial cell culture\nPrimary human alveolar type 2 cells (AT-II) that have been immortalized with SV40 were purchased from Applied Biological Materials, Inc. (Richmond, BC, Canada) and cultured in PriGrow III medium (ABM, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in collagen-coated flasks at 37°C in 5% CO2, as directed by the supplier. When a tissue culture flask approached 80–90% confluency, the cells were lifted by trypsin-EDTA treatment, washed and then either passaged to another collagen-coated T-75 flask, seeded into collagen-coated wells of a 24 well dish or seeded into wells containing collagen-coated coverslips. The trypsinized cells were spun down and resuspended in 2–3 ml of fresh tissue culture media to remove the trypsin-EDTA. Cells were quantitated with a hemacytometer and then 1 ml of cell suspension containing 3 x 105 cells was seeded into the desired number of wells of a 24 well tissue culture plate the day before the cells were to be infected.\n\nQuantitative epithelial cell growth assays\nApproximately 3 x 105 AT-II cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 with mid to late log phase (OD600 0.5–0.9) cultures of F. tularensis SchuS4, F. tularensis SchuS4 waaY::TrgTn, or F. tularensis LVS. After 4 hours, the infected AT-II cells were washed three times with PBS before adding fresh tissue culture media containing 50 μg per ml of gentamicin for 1 hour to kill extracellular bacteria. After gentamicin treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the gentamicin and fresh antibiotic-free media was added to each well for the remainder of the assay. AT-II cell monolayers were lysed at 4, 16 or 24 hours with 1% saponin followed by serial dilution to quantitate the number of internalized bacteria in each well. Dilutions of the original inoculum were also plated and percent uptake was determined for the 4 hour time point. Bacteria recovered at later time points were compared to the 4 hour time point to determine the level of growth for each strain.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining and microscopy\nAT-II cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips in 24 well dishes and infected according to the protocol described above. At 4, 16 or 24 hours post-infection the infected cells on the coverslips were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes, permeabilized with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 15 minutes, washed with PBS and then stored in blocking buffer until immunostaining was performed. Immunostaining was performed using mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody diluted 1:10,000 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were acquired from the University of Iowa Central Microscopy and used at a dilution of 1:500. Samples were viewed and images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope.\n\nMurine infections\nBALB/c female mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Each mouse was anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and then immediately infected intranasally with F. tularensis SchuS4, F. tularensis SchuS4 waaY::TrgTn or F. tularensis LVS in a volume of 50 μl. Since there are published estimates that mouse lungs contain approximately 106 alveoli [25–27], approximately 108 cfu of each strain (MOI of 100) were inoculated intranasally to significantly increase the probability of observing early interactions of the bacteria with lung cells. Bacterial doses were estimated from OD600 readings and were confirmed by serial dilution and enumeration on agar plates. All work with viable F. tularensis strains was performed within the Carver College of Medicine Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Core Facility and all experimental protocols were reviewed for safety by the BSL3 Oversight Committee of The University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. Work with recombinant F. tularensis strains was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee at the University of Iowa. All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by The University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use committee.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nMice were euthanized at either 16 or 24 hours post infection and lungs were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Lungs were removed by dissection from each mouse and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days. After 2 days, one lung was homogenized and plated for a BSL-3 sterility control. The other lung samples were placed into 2.5% gluteraldehyde to await the sterility test result. Upon demonstration that samples were sterile, lung sections were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as previously described [28, 29]. Briefly, samples were washed 3 times in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer and then fixed in a 1% osmium, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide solution for 1 hour. Samples were then washed for 15 minutes in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations starting with 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and ending with 100% ethanol. After the ethanol washes, Epon resin was perfused into each sample by equilibrating the samples for 1 hour each first in a 2:1 (ethanol:Epon) solution, then a 1:1 solution and finally a 1:2 solution. Samples were then placed in gel capsules and embedded in fresh Epon and placed in a 60°C oven overnight. 70 nm sections were cut from the hardened blocks using an ultramicrotome and the samples were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Peabody MA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nTwo-tailed Student’s T-tests were performed with two sample equal variance using Microsoft Excel software. Values of p < 0.01 were used as statistically significant.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127458/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000458/references","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164556","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nThe 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (HMG)/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) aldolase is the last enzyme of both the gallate and protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathways which links aromatic catabolism to central cellular metabolism.

Viable tubercle bacilli were cultivated from all eyes by Day 56 after aerosol delivery of ∼200 bacilli to guinea pig lungs. Choroidal tuberculous granulomas showed reduced oxygen tension, as evidenced by staining with the hypoxia-specific probe pimonidazole, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors.

The in vitro growth of this strain was assessed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm.\n      \n        Animal infections\n        Twenty female outbred Hartley guinea pigs (250–300 g) were purchased from Charles River Labs (Wilmington, MA) and were infected in a Madison chamber aerosol generation device (College of Engineering Shops, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) calibrated to deliver approximately 100 bacilli of wild-type MTB CDC1551 into guinea pig lungs, as previously described [49]. Four guinea pigs from each group were euthanized at Days 1, 14, 28, 56, and 84 after infection. At necropsy, lungs and eyes were removed aseptically and examined. The right eye from each animal was homogenized for CFU enumeration and the contralateral eye was processed for histology. The lungs were homogenized in 10–20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a Kinematica Polytron Homogenizer with a 12-mm generator (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc, Westbury, New York) within a BSL-III Glovebox Cabinet (Germfree Laboratories, Ormond Beach, Florida), as previously described [20]. Eyes were homogenized in 2–3 ml PBS using a glass homogenizer. Undiluted eye homogenates and serial tenfold dilution of lung homogenates were plated on 7H11 selective agar (BBL). Plates were incubated at 37°C and CFU were counted 4 weeks later. The left eye of each animal was paraffin-embedded and stained with Hematoxylin-eosin and Ziehl-Neelson acid-fast staining. Ocular and lung tissues for these experiments were obtained from animals included in a larger study evaluating an MTB recombinant mutant, the results of which will be published separately.\n      \n        Retinal Imaging\n        Funduscopic imaging was obtained using a compact, contact GRIN lens [50], [51], designed and constructed using standard optical and mechanical components: a Nikon D500 digital camera, an otoscope, a Karl Storz 611C Xenon light source, standard optical lenses, and mounts [52]. Animals were anesthetized using 400 ml/kg body weight of anesthetic constituting ketamine (100 mg/ml) and Xylazine (20 mg/ml) in normal saline. Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% was used for additional topical anesthesia. Each pupil was then dilated with 10% phenylephrine. A small amount of 2.5% methylcellulose gel was applied to the eye and the camera was placed in direct contact with the corneal surface. Fundus images were recorded at Day 1, 14, 28, 56 and 84 after aerosol infection.\n      \n        Immunohistochemistry\n        At predetermined time points, guinea pigs were injected with pimonidazole hydrochloride (Hypoxiprobe-1, HPI, MA) 4 hours prior to euthanasia. Immediately upon sacrifice, the lower left lobe of the lungs and the left eyes were placed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours before histological specimens were prepared. The paraffin-embedded sections of the eye were deparaffinized, hydrated and quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Antigen retrieval was performed at 40°C by exposing to 0.01% Pronase for 40 minutes. Tissue sections were treated with IgG1 mouse monoclonal antibody (HPI, MA) as the primary antibody and stained with the Streptavidin-Biotin 2 system, horseradish peroxidase according to manufacturer's instructions (DAKO). The sections were mounted and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse 55i microscope.\n        To detect VEGF expression in retina, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, paraffin-embedded sections from non-exposed control animals and infected animals were subjected to immunohistochemical evaluation. Five-micron thick sections were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval by covering the sections with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer/0.05% tween-20 (pH 6.0), and heating them for 30 seconds. Slides were then cooled to room temperature for 30 minutes, rinsed with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 minutes at room temperature.

VHL mutations were found to be universal throughout individual tumors when it occurred (ubiquitous), while the mutations in other tumor suppressor genes tended to be detected only in parts of the tumors (subclonal). ITH has been studied mostly by DNA sequencing in limited numbers of samples, either by whole genome sequencing or by targeted sequencing. It is not known whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used as a tool to study ITH. To address this question, we examined the protein expression of PBRM1, and PBRM1-related proteins such as ARID1A, SETD2, BRG1, and BRM. Altogether, 160 ccRCC (40 per stage) were used to generate a tissue microarray (TMA), with four foci from each tumor included. Loss of expression was defined as 0–5% of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining in an individual focus. We found that 49/160 (31%), 81/160 (51%), 23/160 (14%), 24/160 (15%), and 61/160 (38%) of ccRCC showed loss of expression of PBRM1, ARID1A, SETD2, BRG1, and BRM, respectively, and that IHC could successfully detect a high prevalence of ITH. Phylogenetic trees were constructed that reflected the ITH. Striking co-losses among proteins were also observed. For instance, ARID1A loss almost always accompanied PBRM1 loss, whereas BRM loss accompanied loss of BRG1, PBRM1 or ARID1A. SETD2 loss frequently occurred with loss of one or more of the other four proteins. Finally, in order to learn the impact of combined losses, we compared the tumor growth after cells acquired losses of ARID1A, PBRM1, or both in a xenograft model. The results suggest that ARID1A loss has a greater tumor-promoting effect than PBRM1 loss, indicating that xenograft analysis is a useful tool to investigate how these losses impact on tumor behavior, either alone or in combination.\n"],"title":"Immunohistochemistry Successfully Uncovers Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Widespread Co-Losses of Chromatin Regulators in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma","materials_and_methods":["\nSample preparation and TMA preparation\nWritten informed patient consent was obtained under a protocol (IRB#13–810) approved by the IACUC of Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). All samples were collected in accordance with institutional guidelines and protocols.\nAltogether, 160 ccRCC patients with available archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue were identified based on a search of the FCCC kidney cancer database; 40 cases from each of the 4 stages (Stage I-IV) were randomly selected. All cases were reviewed by the same pathologist (E.D.). Four different, well-separated areas from each tumor were selected for assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity. Eight TMAs were generated by the FCCC Biosample Repository.\n\nIHC and scoring\nAntigen retrieval was performed with the Ventana Discovery ULTRA staining platform, using Discovery CCI (Ventana cat. #950–500) for a total application time of 64 min. Primary immunostaining was performed using antibodies against PBRM1 (1:50), ARID1A (1:250), BRM (1:50), BRG1 (1:200), and SEDT2 (1:100) using Ventana Antibody Dilution Buffer (Ventana cat. #ADB250) with a 44-min incubation at room temperature. Secondary immunostaining used a rabbit Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) multimer cocktail (Ventana cat#760–500) and immune complexes were visualized using the ultraView Universal DAB (diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) Detection Kit (Ventana cat#760–500). Slides were then washed with a Tris-based reaction buffer (Ventana cat. #950–300) and stained with Hematoxylin II (Ventana cat. #790–2208) for 8 min. The antibodies used were: PBRM1 (Bethyl labs, cat. # A301-591A), ARID1A (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # HPA005456), BRM (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # HPA029981), BRG1 (Abcam, cat. # ab110641), and SETD2 (ProSci, cat. # 30–305).\nTwo pathologists (W.J., T.P.) independently performed the scoring of the immunostained TMAs. The staining of tumor foci was scored as 2 if greater than 50% of tumor cells were positive, 1 if less than 50% but greater than 5% of tumor cells were positive, and 0 if less than 5% of tumor cells were positive. In the cases where the foci had different scores, two pathologists examined these foci together to reach a consensus. For each tumor, if one marker was scored as 0 in one focus, then that tumor is also considered to have a score of 0 for that marker.\n\nCell culture\nKidney cancer cell lines 786-O and Ren-02 were previously described [19, 20]. All cell lines were maintained in glutamine-containing DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.\n\nWestern blot\nCells were washed in PBS buffer before being lysed with EBC buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 120 mM NaCl; 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. The same total amount of each lysate was loaded and resolved by SDS–PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The blots were developed with Super Signal Pico substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) or Immobilon Western substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The antibodies were the same as the ones used for IHC.\n\nShort hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)\nAll the shRNA constructs except for SCR were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO).

The subcutaneous nude-mice xenograft assay was performed as described [21]. For each cell line, 107 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. Each mouse was injected with two cell lines, one on each flank. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before injection. The mice were monitored once weekly by an investigator from Yang lab during the experiment and daily by the staff of the animal facility. The mice were followed according to an early/humane endpoint protocol, with. euthanization of animals if the tumors become ulcerated, impede the mice’s ability to reach food and water, or cause weight loss of 20%. In our experiments, no mouse died before the experimental endpoint. The mice were maintained in groups of five per cage with 12 hours of light and 12 hour of darkness light cycle. Food and water were monitored daily by staff from the animal facility. Forty immunocompromised male nu/nu nude mice of four weeks old were purchased from Taconic or Jackson labs. All mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation 8 to 10 weeks after injection of cells, and tumors were excised and weighed.\nResults are reported as mean ± s.e. of the mean.

These results have led to suggestions that DAT KO mice may model features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and that these drugs may act upon serotonin (5-HT) systems to produce these unusual locomotor decreasing effects. Evidence from patterns of brain expression and initial pharmacologic studies led us to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to examine the influence of altered 5-HT1B receptor activity on hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Heterozygous 5-HT1B KO and pharmacologic 5-HT1B antagonism both attenuated locomotor hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Furthermore, DAT KO mice with reduced, but not eliminated, 5-HT1B receptor expression regained cocaine-stimulated locomotion, which was absent in DAT KO mice with normal levels of 5-HT1B receptor expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the degree of habituation to the testing apparatus determined whether cocaine had no effect on locomotion in DAT KO or reduced locomotion, helping to resolve differences among prior reports. These findings of complementation of the locomotor effects of DAT KO by reducing 5-HT1B receptor activity underscore roles for interactions between specific 5-HT receptors and dopamine (DA) systems in basal and cocaine-stimulated locomotion and support evaluation of 5-HT1B antagonists as potential, non-stimulant ADHD therapeutics.\n"],"title":"Serotonin/Dopamine Interactions in a Hyperactive Mouse: Reduced Serotonin Receptor 1B Activity Reverses Effects of Dopamine Transporter Knockout","materials_and_methods":["\nSubjects\nDAT [12] and 5-HT1B receptor [83] KO mice were used to generate combined DAT/5-HT1B KO mice by crosses of these lines to produce double heterozygous KO mice in the F1 generation, and subsequent double heterozygous crosses that resulted in all combinations of genotypes, including double homozygous KO mice, beginning in the F2 generation. Mice were of a mixed genetic background, C57BL/6J and 129/Sv, derived from each of the original KO strains. Mice were tested at 12–18 weeks of age. The number of subjects per condition in each particular experiment is listed below. Each genotype group consisted of equal numbers of males and female mice, but this was not included in the analysis and the group sizes are not listed separately by sex below. The majority of mice used in these studies were products of double heterozygous crosses, however, because of the rarity of double KO and double WT mice under these conditions, and the increased mortality that has been noted in DAT KO mice previously, an additional breeding strategy was used to produce a sufficient number of subjects; this involved crosses of DAT+/−5-HT1B +/+, DAT +/+5-HT1B +/−, and DAT +/−5-HT1B −/− mice. All of these breeder mice were derived from double heterozygous crosses. Crosses of all genotypes produced similar initial litter sizes and expected genotype distributions (given the increased DAT mortality). Those crosses that produced higher numbers of DAT −/− mice than double heterozygote crosses did have greater postnatal and post-weaning mortality which was solely attributable to the loss of DAT −/− mice. No gross abnormalities or behavioral phenotypes were obvious in double KO mice beyond those that have already been reported for the single KO mice. All experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (USA) guidelines governing the use of animals in experimental research under protocols approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA) Intramural Research Program Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number 10-MNRB-07).\n\nGenotyping\nMice were genotyped by PCR for DAT and 5-HT1B genotypes using two internal primers, one targeted at the NEO portion of the transgenic construct (KO primer) and one targeted at the WT gene (WT primer), and one external primer for each gene. PCR using Takara ExTaq or e2Tak DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan) was performed on tail DNA eluted after digestion overnight in Protease K. For DAT genotyping the forward primer (5′ GAC TTG CTG TGA CCT GGC TAG GAA C 3′) and the WT primer (5′ GCC TTG AGC TCT TAT CGG GCC TCC 3′) produced a 640 bp band, while the forward primer and the KO primer (5′ GCC TCT GTC CGC AGT TCA TTC AG 3′) produced a 900 bp band. For 5-HT1B receptor genotyping the forward primer (5′ GAC TTG GTT CAC GTA CAC AG 3′) and the WT primer (5′ CCC ATC AGC ACC ATG TAC AC 3′) produced a 560 bp band, while the forward primer and the KO primer (5′ CTT CTA TCG CCT TCT TGA CG 3′) produced a 680 bp band. The PCR products were separated and visualized using gel electrophoresis for determination of individual genotypes.\n\nLocomotor Activity Testing\nLocomotor activity was assessed in Plexiglas boxes (36×18×18 cm) using an automated Optovarimax system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). The total distance traveled during each time bin was calculated from infrared beam-breaks by ATS software that localized the subject’s position in the apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). The locomotor activity monitors were placed in sound-attenuating chambers and all locomotor activity was assessed under dark conditions between 10 AM and 4 PM. The methods used to examine locomotor behavior are generally similar to our previous publications with DAT KO and DAT/SERT KO mice [11], [12]. Habituation, duration of testing and timing of drug injections was different for each experiment. These details are described below.\n\nExperiment 1: Basal and Cocaine-induced Locomotor Activity after an Extended Period of Habituation\nUsing a within subjects design, mice from all 9 DAT/5-HT1B double KO genotype combinations (n = 9–11 per genotype) were placed in the locomotor test chambers and allowed to habituate for 3 hours prior to injection with cocaine (0.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg s.c.). At least 48 hours separated each testing day. The order of doses was counter-balanced. Locomotor activity was assessed as described above. There was no evidence for locomotor sensitization when the order of testing was examined as a factor using analysis of variance (ANOVA; data not presented).\n\nExperiment 2: Cocaine-induced Locomotor Activity after a Brief Period of Habituation\nTo allow comparison to the results of previously reported locomotor studies in DAT KO mice that have used different periods of pre-injection habituation [10]–[13], locomotor activity was also assessed in all 9 genotypes of DAT/5-HT1B double KO mice (N = 8–13 per genotype) after 30 minutes of habituation to the locomotor test chambers, using a within-subjects design after injections with 0 (saline vehicle) or 20 mg/kg s.c. cocaine. At least 48 hours separated each testing day and the dose order was counter-balanced.\n\nExperiment 3: Effects of the 5-HT antagonist SB224289 on locomotor activity in DAT KO and WT mice\nLocomotor activity was assessed in DAT −/− and wildtype, DAT +/+ littermates (n = 10 mice per genotype) as previously described. Mice were injected with the 5-HT1B antagonist SB224289 (0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) prior to placement in locomotor activity chambers for 1 hour. A within-subjects design was used, at least 48 hours separated each testing day and the dose order was counter-balanced.\n\nStatistics\nStatistical comparisons were made with ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s post hoc comparisons using Statview (SAS). Data are presented as mean ± SEM for each experimental group. In Experiment 1 there were substantial differences in basal activity across genotypes observed during the long habituation period. This difference in activity between genotypes did not equalize even by the end of this extended period of habituation. The habituation sessions were compared to each other to determine if the patterns observed in the first exposure were maintained or if there were differences in habituation resulting from DAT GENOTYPE or 5-HT1B GENOTYPE or any other factors. Because the activity of the groups was not equalized by the end of the habituation period, cocaine-induced locomotion was analyzed in terms of difference scores of the summed activity over the two hours of testing post-cocaine minus the summed activity over the 2 hours of baseline activity immediately prior to cocaine injection. Since the short habituation data in Experiment 2 did not allow this correction, the difference in locomotor activity after saline injection was compared to locomotor activity after cocaine injection in the initial ANOVA, and then the time-course of cocaine and saline responses was examined in separate ANOVA for each genotype. In ANOVA, the between-subjects factors used were DAT GENOTYPE and 5-HT1B GENOTYPE, along with the within-subjects factors TIME (for baseline locomotion), habituation SESSION (for pre-cocaine habituation sessions) and DOSE of cocaine or SB 224289, where appropriate.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115009/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015961","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        The mouse is an important model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of body weight regulation, but a quantitative understanding of mouse energy metabolism remains lacking. Therefore, we created a mathematical model of mouse energy metabolism to predict dynamic changes of body weight, body fat, energy expenditure, and metabolic fuel selection. Based on the principle of energy balance, we constructed ordinary differential equations representing the dynamics of body fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) as a function of dietary intake and energy expenditure (EE). The EE model included the cost of tissue deposition, physical activity, diet-induced thermogenesis, and the influence of FM and FFM on metabolic rate. The model was calibrated using previously published data and validated by comparing its predictions to measurements in five groups of male C57/BL6 mice (N = 30) provided ad libitum access to either chow or high fat diets for varying time periods. The mathematical model accurately predicted the observed body weight and FM changes. Physical activity was predicted to decrease immediately upon switching from the chow to the high fat diet and the model coefficients relating EE to FM and FFM agreed with previous independent estimates. Metabolic fuel selection was predicted to depend on a complex interplay between diet composition, the degree of energy imbalance, and body composition. This is the first validated mathematical model of mouse energy metabolism and it provides a quantitative framework for investigating energy balance relationships in mouse models of obesity and diabetes.\n      "],"title":"Predicting Changes of Body Weight, Body Fat, Energy Expenditure and Metabolic Fuel Selection in C57BL/6 Mice","materials_and_methods":["\n        Modeling Energy Expenditure and Body Composition Change\n        We begin with the law of energy conservation, also known as the energy balance equation:(1)where  = 9.4 kcal/g and  = 1.8 kcal/g are the energy densities for changes in FM and FFM, respectively [5]. EI is the total metabolizable energy intake rate corrected for spillage. We assumed that the calculated metabolizable energy intake based on food intake measurements adequately accounted for any differences of digestibility between the diets. We did not directly measure the energy content of the feces to confirm this assumption.\n        We previously showed that there is a well-defined, time-invariant function, α, that describes the relationship between changes of FFM and FM in adult male C57BL/6 mice:(2)where the parameters c = 0.1, d = 1.89×10−4, and k = 0.45 g−1 specify the shape of the empirically measured function α [6]. This function allows us to write equation 1 as a pair of differential equations specifying the rates of change of FM and FFM [6], [7]:(3)\n        Given measurements of EI, solving equation 3 requires a model of EE which was adapted from published human models [8]–[10]:(4)where K is a thermogenesis parameter which was assumed to be constant for a fixed environmental temperature and λ represents physical activity whose energy cost was assumed to be proportional to BW. The values for K and λ were determined in the model calibration procedure described below. The parameter β accounts for the thermic effect of feeding as well as adaptive changes of EE as a result of diet changes. We will refer to the product βΔEI as diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) where ΔEI is the change of energy intake compared to baseline chow and the value β  = 0.4 was determined in a recent analysis of rodent feeding and body composition data [11]. The parameters ηFM  = 0.18 kcal/g and ηFFM  = 0.23 kcal/g account for the biochemical efficiencies associated with fat and protein synthesis [11] assuming that the change of fat-free mass is primarily accounted for by body protein and its associated intracellular water [5].\n        The parameters γFFM and γFM determine how metabolic rate varies with FFM and FM, respectively. To estimate the values of γFFM and γFM, we note that basal metabolic rate (BMR) across species is well described by the Kleiber 3/4 power law of BW:\n        BMR ∼ BW ¾ [12]. Within a species, FFM and FM are proportional to BW. Therefore,(5)and(6)\n        Using equation 6 to rescale the human values of γFFM  = 22 kcal/kg/d and γFM  = 3.6 kcal/kg/d [13] results in mouse values of γFFM  = 0.15 kcal/g/d and γFM  = 0.03 kcal/g/d.\n      \n        Data for Model Calibration\n        The calibration data were obtained from a previously described study, the results of which are depicted in Figure 1 [14]. Briefly, we studied 47 three-month-old male C57BL/6 mice that were individually housed at a temperature of 22°C and randomly assigned to five groups: 1) C group (N = 12) on a chow diet (24% protein, 12% fat, and 64% carb.); 2) HF group (N = 12) on a high fat diet (14% protein, 59% fat, 27% carb.); 3) EN group (N = 11) on a high fat diet plus liquid Ensure® (14% protein, 22% fat, 64% carb.); 4) HF-C group (N = 6) switched from high fat to chow after 7 weeks; 5) EN-C group (N = 6) switched from high fat plus Ensure® to chow after 7 weeks. All animals received free access to water and food throughout the study. The high fat diet was provided using Rodent CAFÉ feeders (OYC International, Inc., MA), and liquid Ensure was provided in a 30-ml bottle with a rodent sip tube (Unifab Co., MI) and liquid intake was measured every day. Solid food intake was corrected for any visible spillage and was measured every day for the high fat diet and every other day for the chow diet using a balance with a precision of 0.01 g (Ohaus model SP402). Body composition was measured using 1H NMR spectroscopy (EchoMRI 3-in-1, Echo Medical Systems LTD, Houston, TX) and was recorded longitudinally throughout the study along with food intake and BW. The BW and FM at the beginning of the study were used as the initial values for the model inputs.\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0015961.g001\n          Figure 1\n          \n            Mathematical model calibration.\n            BW (A) and FM (B) data were obtained from 47 male C57BL/6 mice that were randomly assigned to five groups: the C group (solid circles) on a chow diet; the HF group (solid blue triangles) on a high fat diet; the EN group (solid magenta squares) on a high fat diet plus liquid Ensure; the HF-C group (open red triangles) switched from high fat to chow after 7 weeks; and the EN-C group (open green squares) switched from high fat plus Ensure to chow after 7 weeks. The solid curves are the mathematical model fit to these data. Error bars have been suppressed for clarity.\n          \n          \n        \n        We certify that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during this research. All procedures were approved by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol K009-LBM-07.\n      \n        Model Calibration Procedure\n        We assumed that the physical activity parameter λ depended on the diet as described by the following differential equation:(7)where the initial value λ(0)  =  λC0 was the physical activity for the baseline chow diet group, C. For the HF, EN, HF-C and EN-C mice that were switched to a high energy diet at time tswitch1, the physical activity parameter was assumed to change immediately to the value λH (as implemented using the Dirac delta function, δ) and to remain at this level during the high energy diet (as implemented using the Heaviside function, Θ). For the HF-C and EN-C mice switched back to the chow diet at time tswitch2 we assumed that they immediately changed their physical activity to the value λC1 which then exponentially relaxed to a value of λC2 with a time constant of τ  = 14 days.\n        The model equations were numerically solved with the ODE45 solver using MATLAB software version R2008a (http://www.mathworks.com). While most model parameters were defined from analysis of previous data as stated above and tabulated in Table 1, the parameters K, λC0, λC1, λC2, and λH had to be estimated using data from our calibration experiment. The parameter values were determined using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method where random guesses for the parameter values are proposed along with a simple rule for updating the parameter values depending on how closely the model results match the data [15]. Specifically, the model was run for 100,000 rounds for each group of mice and the first 30000 were discarded as a burn-in period with one fifth of the subsequent rounds were retained. Parameter sets were drawn from a proposal density that was normally distributed and centered on the previous value. The variance of the proposal density was tuned for an average acceptance rate of around 0.25 during the burn-in period. The convergence of the chain was assessed both by visual inspection of the trace plots for all the parameters and through the Geweke test [16]. At each sampling, the probability of accepting the new parameter set given current parameter set was min(1, r), where r is the Metropolis ratio. The energy intake in each group of animals was normally distributed with a standard error of 0.39, 0.39, 0.41, 0.55, and 0.55 Kcal/d for the C, HF, EN, HF-C, and EN-C groups, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals of the predicted energy output were obtained by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution of energy output.\n        10.1371/journal.pone.0015961.t001Table 1\n            Mathematical model symbols and parameter values.\n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Symbol\n                Description\n                Role\n                Value\n                Units\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  IF\n                \n                Metabolizable fat intake\n                Input\n                \n                kcal/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  IP\n                \n                Metabolizable protein intake\n                Input\n                \n                kcal/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  IC\n                \n                Metabolizable carbohydrate intake\n                Input\n                \n                kcal/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  FM\n                \n                Body fat mass\n                Output\n                \n                g\n              \n              \n                \n                  FFM\n                \n                Fat-free mass\n                Output\n                \n                g\n              \n              \n                \n                  EE\n                \n                Total energy expenditure rate\n                Output\n                \n                kcal/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  RQ\n                \n                Respiratory quotient\n                Output\n                \n                —\n              \n              \n                \n                  ρFM\n                \n                Energy density of fat mass changes\n                Parameter\n                9.4\n                kcal/g\n              \n              \n                \n                  ρFFM\n                \n                Energy density of lean mass changes\n                Parameter\n                1.8\n                kcal/g\n              \n              \n                \n                  γFM\n                \n                Metabolic rate of body fat mass\n                Parameter\n                0.03\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  γFFM\n                \n                Metabolic rate of fat-free mass\n                Parameter\n                0.15\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  ηFM\n                \n                Deposition cost for body fat\n                Parameter\n                0.18\n                kcal/g\n              \n              \n                \n                  ηFFM\n                \n                Deposition cost for fat-free mass\n                Parameter\n                0.23\n                kcal/g\n              \n              \n                \n                  β\n                \n                Diet-induced thermogenesis\n                Parameter\n                0.4\n                —\n              \n              \n                λC0\n                Physical activity at baseline\n                Parameter*\n                0.22\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                λC1\n                Physical activity immediately after switching from high fat to chow\n                Parameter*\n                0.27\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                λC2\n                Physical activity at steady state after switching from high fat to chow\n                Parameter*\n                0.19\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                λH\n                Physical activity on a high fat diet\n                Parameter*\n                0.13\n                kcal/g/d\n              \n              \n                \n                  K\n                \n                Basal thermogenesis rate\n                Parameter*\n                2.1\n                kcal/d\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              The parameters indicated with ‘*’ were determined by the model calibration procedure to minimize the difference between the simulated and observed BW and FM changes in the calibration experiment.

The chow and high fat diets were identical to the diets used in the calibration study. The body composition (Tables S1 and S2) and energy intake data (Table S3) are provided as Supporting Information.\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0015961.g002\n          Figure 2\n          \n            Experimental groups used for model validation.\n            Mice were assigned to five different groups and provided ad libitum access to either a standard chow diet (black) or a high fat diet (red) for varying durations: 1) the control group on a chow diet (N = 6); 2) the 7HF-C group on a high fat diet for 7 wk followed by a switch to chow (N = 6); 3) the HF-C-HF-C on a high fat diet for 7 wk followed by a switch to chow for 3 wk, back on the high fat diet for 10 wk and followed by a switch back to chow (N = 6); 4) the 20HF-C on a high fat diet for 20 wk followed by a switch to chow (N = 6); 5) the 4HF-C group on high fat diet for 4 wk followed by a switch to chow (N = 6).\n          \n          \n        \n        The measured food intake rates were used as model inputs to predict BW and FM in the validation experiment and no model parameter values were adjusted. The energy intake in each group of animals was normally distributed with a standard error of 0.42, 0.48, 0.50, 0.53, and 0.55 kcal/d for the five groups, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals of the predicted energy output were obtained by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution of EE.\n      \n        Metabolic Fuel Selection and the Respiratory Quotient\n        Since we are also interested in metabolic fuel selection, we considered the fates of dietary macronutrients including their oxidation rates, storage in the body, as well as major inter-conversion fluxes de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and gluconeogenesis (GNG). The following macronutrient balance equations represented these changes:(8)where P is body protein, G is glycogen, and IF, IP and IC are the metabolizable intake rates of dietary fat, protein and carbohydrate, respectively. The oxidation rates of fat, protein, and carbohydrate (FatOx, ProtOx, and CarbOx, respectively) sum to EE.\n        To simplify the macronutrient balance equations, we note that glycogen stores are small, especially when compared with daily carbohydrate intake rates [6].

Our description is focused on continuous-time LDQBDs, but the discrete-time case is similar.\nConsider a CTMC with infinite multi-dimensional state space. If the state space can be partitioned into disjoint levels, consecutively numbered such that transitions are only possible between states belonging to the same or adjacent levels, then the CTMC is said to be a quasi birth-and-death (QBD) process and its generator matrix is block tridiagonal [31, 32]. The partitioning of the state space can be expressed by the disjoint union S = S ( 0 ) ∪ S ( 1 ) ∪ S ( 2 ) ∪ ⋯ with S ( i ) ∩ S ( j ) = ∅ for i ≠ j, where S denotes the whole state space of the CTMC and S ( 0 ) , S ( 1 ) , S ( 2 ) , … denote the levels successively numbered by 0, 1, 2, …. Usually, one component of the state space is defined as the level number (see, e.g., [23–25, 27, 28, 31, 32] for more details on the level definition) and QBDs are commonly classified according to the dependence of transition rates on the level.\nIn the case of level independent QBDs, the transition rates do not depend on the process level and the corresponding generator matrices obey a structure of repeated identical blocks. The equilibrium distribution then has matrix-geometric form based on which efficient and numerically stable algorithms are available [26, 30–32]. However, for stochastic epidemics with demography level independent QBDs are not appropriate, because infection and recovery rates as well as birth rates and death rates of individuals should depend on the population size of the corresponding epidemiological class.\nIf the transition rates are allowed to depend on the level (transition rates are functions of the level), the process is referred to as a level-dependent QBD (LDQBD) process. Although they are more complicated to analyze than level independent QBDs, some notable matrix-analytic approaches for computing equilibrium distributions of LDQBDs exist [24, 27, 29]. In particular, the algorithm recently proposed by [24] provides an efficient and numerically stable means for this purpose. The art of LDQBD process construction is the appropriate choice of the level and obtaining the block matrices for specific models, which we shall investigate in the following two sections for our stochastic epidemics such that it becomes clear that LDQBDs are appropriate for stochastic epidemic modeling. Once an LDQBD process has been constructed, its equilibrium distribution can be efficiently obtained by matrix-analytic methods.\nHence, assume that we have constructed an LDQBD process such that the generator matrix of the CTMC is block tridiagonal, that is,\nQ = Q ˜ 00 Q ˜ 01  Q ˜ 10 Q ˜ 11 Q ˜ 12  Q ˜ 21 Q ˜ 22 Q ˜ 23  ⋱ ⋱ ⋱ (1)\nwith blocks Q ˜ m n ∈ R d m × d n, where dm and dn are the numbers of states in levels m and n, respectively, that is, d m = | S ( m ) | and d n = | S ( n ) |. Note that the dimension of the state space must be finite, but it is allowed that the state space is infinite, which is the case as soon as one component is not upper bounded. We only require the above block tridiagonal matrix structure.\nFor an ergodic CTMC the equilibrium distribution π is the unique positive solution to πQ = 0 subject to the normalization condition π 1 = 1. Now, let the equilibrium distribution π be partitioned compatibly with Q, that is, π = ( π ˜ 0 , π ˜ 1 , π ˜ 2 … ) with row subvectors π ˜ n ∈ R 1 × d n. Then πQ = 0 can be expressed as\nπ ˜ 0 Q ˜ 00 + π ˜ 1 Q ˜ 10 = 0 , (2) π ˜ n - 1 Q ˜ n - 1 , n + π ˜ n Q ˜ n n + π ˜ n + 1 Q ˜ n + 1 , n = 0 , n > 0 . (3)\nInserting this into the recurrence scheme π ˜ n + 1 = π ˜ n R n , n ≥ 0, with nonnegative matrices R n ∈ R d n × d n + 1 whose entries are conditional sojourn times [27] we get\nπ ˜ 0 ( Q ˜ 00 + R 0 Q ˜ 10 ) = 0 , (4) π ˜ n - 1 ( Q ˜ n - 1 , n + R n - 1 Q n n + R n - 1 R n Q ˜ n + 1 , n ) = 0 , n > 0 , (5)\nwhere\nR n - 1 = - Q ˜ n - 1 , n ( Q ˜ n n + R n Q ˜ n + 1 , n ) - 1 , n > 0 (6)\ncan be computed recursively, given a suitable RN for some finite N as a starting point. According to [24] one can set RN: = 0 for N large enough that the probability mass in levels higher than N is negligibly small. Then the generator matrix is truncated accordingly, without any augmentation necessary. This yields the following core algorithm for computing equilibrium distributions of LDQBDs:\n\n\nChoose N large and define R N = 0 ∈ R d N × d N + 1;\n\n\nFor n = N − 1, N − 2, …, 0 compute R n = - Q ˜ n , n + 1 ( Q ˜ n + 1 , n + 1 + R n + 1 Q ˜ n + 2 , n + 1 ) - 1;\n\n\nDetermine a nontrivial solution x0 ≠ 0 of x 0 ( Q ˜ 00 + R 0 Q ˜ 10 ) = 0;\n\n\nFor n = 0, …, N − 1 compute xn+1 = xn Rn;\n\n\nBy normalizing x = (x0, …, xN), determine π = ( π ˜ 0 , π ˜ 1 , π ˜ 2 … ), that is,\nπ ˜ n = x n | | x 0 | | + ⋯ + | | x N | | ,\nwhere ||⋅|| denotes the row sum norm.\n\n\nFurther details and a memory-efficient implementation are given in [24] where also the efficiency of the matrix-analytic computations is demonstrated.\n\nGeneralized stochastic SI(S) models\nIn SI and SIS models the population consists of susceptibles and infectives. The state of the underlying CTMC is denoted by (s, i) where s is the number of susceptible individuals and i is the number of infected individuals. Both susceptibles and infectives can immigrate or can be born and they can die (or emigrate). Susceptibles can be infected and infectives can recover. With some constants we have the state transitions starting in (s, i) as given in Table 1.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152144.t001\nTable 1\n\nState transitions in generalized stochastic SI and SIS models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nNext state\nTransition rate\n\n\n\n\nBirth/Immigration of susceptible\n(s + 1, i)\nλ0 s + a0\n\n\nBirth/Immigration of infective\n(s, i + 1)\nλ1 i + a1\n\n\nDeath of susceptible\n(s − 1, i)\nμ0 s\n\n\nDeath of infective\n(s, i − 1)\nμ1 i\n\n\nInfection of susceptible\n(s − 1, i + 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nβ\n0\n\n\n\ns\n·\ni\n\n\ns\n+\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery of infective\n(s + 1, i − 1)\nγ1 i\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext state and corresponding transition rate when event occurs, given the current state is (s, i). For the SI model the recovery rate is zero, that is, γ1 = 0.\n\n\n\nThe infection rate β 0 s · i s + i is the product of a contact rate β0, the number of susceptible individuals s, and the proportion i/(s + i) of the population that is infected. If the recovery rate is chosen as γ1 = 0 we get a SI model, for γ1 > 0 we have a SIS model. Finally, the basic reproduction number of our model is given by R 0 = β 0 γ 1 + μ 1. Note that the basic reproduction number is a fundamental concept originating from deterministic epidemic models where it is defined as the number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual in an entirely susceptible population, but the concept similarly applies to stochastic models with closed as well as open populations with fluctuating number of susceptibles, for details see, e.g., [9, 16, 17, 34, 35].\nNow, we turn to modeling these stochastic epidemics by LDQBD processes. In order to get the desired block tridiagonal structure of the generator matrix we define the level number as the number of susceptibles and arrange the states in lexicographical order. In the present case, the number of infectives is not bounded by definition. Therefore, in order to get finite blocks we have to choose a truncation number denoted by imax, which can be safely set such that the probability of having more than imax infectives is negligible. Doing so we have the state space S = { 0 , 1 , 2 , … } × { 0 , … , i max }. Since we have defined the level number as the number of susceptibles, which means for any state its first component defines the level number, it is clear that each level consists of imax + 1 states, namely for level number s, corresponding to exactly s susceptibles, the level consists of all states where exactly s susceptibles are present, that is, S ( s ) = { ( s , 0 ) , ( s , 1 ) , … , ( s , i max + 1 ) }. Hence, the generator matrix Q is of block tridiagonal structure with constant dimensions di = imax + 1 and blocks\nQ ˜ n , n + 1 = λ 0 n + a 0  γ 1 λ 0 n + a 0  2 γ 1 λ 0 n + a 0 ⋱ ⋱ i max γ 1 λ 0 n + a 0 , (7) Q ˜ n , n - 1 = μ 0 n β 0 n · 0 n + 0  μ 0 n β 0 n · 1 n + 1  μ 0 n β 0 n · 2 n + 2  ⋱ ⋱ μ 0 n β 0 n · ( i max - 1 ) n + i max - 1 μ 0 n , (8) Q ˜ n n = - ξ n , 0 a 1  μ 1 - ξ n , 1 λ 1 + a 1  ⋱ ⋱ ⋱  ( i max - 1 ) μ 1 - ξ n , i max - 1 ( i max - 1 ) λ 1 + a 1 i max μ 1 - ξ n , i max , (9)\nwhere the definitions for Q ˜ n , n + 1 and Q ˜ n n hold for n ≥ 0, the definition for Q ˜ n , n - 1 holds for n > 0, and ξs, i is defined as\nξ s , i = λ 0 s + a 0 + λ 1 i + a 1 + μ 0 s + μ 1 i + β 0 s i s + i + γ 1 i . (10)\nFor s = i = 0 the term s i s + i is defined to be 0. Note that due to the truncation of the number of infectives not all row sums of Q need to be zero. If the entries of Q ˜ i j are denoted by ( Q ˜ i j ) u , v for u = 0, 1, …, di − 1 and v = 0, 1, …, dj − 1, then we can also define the block matrices formally by all non-zero entries:\nQ ˜ n , n + 1 ( u , v ) = λ 0 n + a 0 , u = 0 , … , i max , v = u , γ 1 u , u = 1 , … , i max , v = u - 1 , (11) Q ˜ n , n - 1 ( u , v ) = μ 0 n , u = 0 , … , i max , v = u , β 0 n u n + u , u = 0 , … , i max - 1 , v = u + 1 , (12) Q ˜ n n ( u , v ) = - ξ n , u , u = 0 , … , i max , v = u , λ 1 u + a 1 , u = 0 , … , i max - 1 , v = u + 1 , μ 1 u , u = 1 , … , i max , v = u - 1 . (13)\n\nGeneralized stochastic SIR(S) models\nIn the SIR model infected individuals become immune (removals) after recovery. Hence, there is a third epidemiological class within the population and we denote by r the number of such immune removals. It is also possible that an immune individual, hence a removal, immigrates or is born into the population. In the SIRS model immunity can be lost and a removal loosing immunity becomes again a susceptible. As for the other epidemiological classes, immune individuals can be born, they can immigrate, die, or emigrate. Starting from state (s, i, r) we have the state transitions as given in Table 2 where for the SIR model the rate of loss of immunity is γ2 = 0 and for the SIRS model γ2 > 0. Note in particular, that now the state space of the underlying CTMC is three-dimensional. The basic reproduction number remains as for the SI(S) models.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152144.t002\nTable 2\n\nState transitions in generalized stochastic SIR and SIRS models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nNext state\nTransition rate\n\n\n\n\nBirth/Immigration of susceptible\n(s + 1, i, r)\nλ0 s + a0\n\n\nBirth/Immigration of infective\n(s, i + 1, r)\nλ1 i + a1\n\n\nBirth/Immigration of removal\n(s, i, r + 1)\nλ2 r + a2\n\n\nDeath of susceptible\n(s − 1, i, r)\nμ0 s\n\n\nDeath of infective\n(s, i − 1, r)\nμ1 i\n\n\nDeath of removal\n(s, i, r − 1)\nμ2 r\n\n\nInfection of susceptible\n(s − 1, i + 1, r)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nβ\n0\n\n·\n\n\ns\ni\n\n\ns\n+\ni\n+\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery from infection to immunity\n(s, i − 1, r + 1)\nγ1 i\n\n\nLoss of immunity\n(s + 1, i, r − 1)\nγ2 r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext state and corresponding transition rate when event occurs, given the current state is (s, i, r). For the SIR model γ2 = 0.\n\n\n\nWe proceed by showing how to model these stochastic epidemics appropriately as an LDQBD process. Again, we choose the level number to be the number s of susceptible individuals. In order to get finite blocks we truncate both the number of infectives and the number of removals, denoting the maximum numbers by imax and rmax, respectively. The block matrix dimensions dn = (imax + 1)(rmax + 1) are constant. We get\nQ ˜ n , n + 1 = Λ Λ ⋱ Λ ∈ R ( i max + 1 ) × ( i max + 1 ) (14)\nwith imax + 1 blocks\nΛ = λ 0 n + a 0 γ 2 λ 0 n + a 0 2 γ 2 λ 0 n + a 0 ⋱ ⋱ r max γ 2 λ 0 n + a 0 (15)\nand\nQ ˜ n , n - 1 = M M 0 M M 1 ⋱ ⋱ M M i max - 1 M (16)\nwith blocks\nM = diag ( λ 0 n + a 0 ) ∈ R ( r max + 1 ) × ( r max + 1 ) , M i = diag β 0 n i n + i + r r = 0 r max .

The catalytic mechanism of RNase A is well understood and absolutely precludes activity on DNA; however anecdotal reports of DNA degradation by RNase A are not uncommon. Here we describe a mechanism by which RNase A treatment can lead to apparent DNA degradation. This results from the surprising finding that RNase A remains functional in a phenol:chloroform mixture, to our knowledge the only enzyme that survives this highly denaturing solvent environment. Although RNase A does not cleave the DNA backbone it is capable of binding to DNA, forming stable RNase A-DNA complexes that partition to the interphase or organic phase during phenol:chloroform purification. The unexpected survival of the RNase A DNA-binding activity in phenol means that these complexes are not dissolved and a substantial amount of RNase A-bound DNA is permanently removed from the aqueous phase and lost on phase separation. This effect will impact DNA recovery from multiple procedures and is likely to represent a source of sequence bias in genome-wide studies. Our results also indicate that the results of analytical studies performed using RNase A must be considered with care.\n"],"title":"Unexpected DNA Loss Mediated by the DNA Binding Activity of Ribonuclease A","materials_and_methods":["NIH/3T3 cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in DMEM (Sigma) with 10% calf serum.

Due to their particular life history traits, long-lived migrants are amongst the most endangered and sensitive group of animals to these harming effects. Our ability to identify and quantify such anthropogenic threats in both breeding and wintering grounds is, therefore, of key importance in the field of conservation biology. Using long-term capture-recapture data (34 years, 4557 individuals) and year-round tracking data (4 years, 100 individuals) of a trans-equatorial migrant, the Cory’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), we investigated the impact of longline fisheries and climatic variables in both breeding and wintering areas on the most important demographic trait of this seabird, i.e. adult survival. Annual adult survival probability was estimated at 0.914±0.022 on average, declining throughout 1978–1999 but recovering during the last decade (2005–2011). Our results suggest that both the incidental bycatch associated with longline fisheries and high sea surface temperatures (indirectly linked to food availability; SST) increased mortality rates during the long breeding season (March-October). Shearwater survival was also negatively affected during the short non-breeding season (December-February) by positive episodes of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Indirect negative effects of climate at both breeding (SST) and wintering grounds (SOI) had a greater impact on survival than longliner activity, and indeed these climatic factors are those which are expected to present more unfavourable trends in the future. Our work underlines the importance of considering both breeding and wintering habitats as well as precise schedules/phenology when assessing the global role of the local impacts on the dynamics of migratory species.\n      "],"title":"Combined Spatio-Temporal Impacts of Climate and Longline Fisheries on the Survival of a Trans-Equatorial Marine Migrant","materials_and_methods":["\n        Study Site and Data Collection\n        The island of Selvagem Grande (30°09′N, 15°52′W; Fig. 1) holds the largest known breeding colony of Cory’s shearwater in the world [39]. There are some historical records of its exploitation at this remote location, with Cory’s shearwater eggs and chicks being intensively exploited for food, oil and feathers through the first two thirds of the 20th century [40]. Constant harvests of chicks but also a few severe killings of adults in the 1970’s, reduced this population from ca. 100,000 breeding pairs (crude estimations at the beginning of the 20th century) to only 5,000 pairs in 1977 [41]. Since then, and due to the establishment of the Selvagens Islands Nature Reserve and a permanent vigilance, the shearwater population has increased and was estimated at ca. 29,540 breeding pairs in 2005 (Fig. 2; [39]). During the breeding season (March-October), Cory’s shearwaters from Selvagem Grande forage to a large extent in the Canary Current, along the Moroccan and Western Sahara coast where productivity is high, owing to the enrichment of the surface waters by a strong upwelling [42], [43]. Most of these trans-equatorial migratory shearwaters congregate in the South Atlantic Ocean during the non-breeding season (November-February), the Benguela Current being one of the most used wintering sites [44], [45].\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0040822.g001\n          Figure 1\n          \n            Distribution of Cory’s shearwaters from Selvagem Grande Island (star) throughout the annual cycle.\n            Schematic annual phenology (starting 1st January) and annual distribution of 100 Cory’s shearwaters tracked with geolocators between 2006 and 2009. Coloured areas encompass bird positions during the breeding and wintering seasons (in orange and dark blue, respectively) and the overall distribution during the migration periods (i.e., when commuting between breeding and wintering areas; in light blue). The main wintering areas were associated with Benguela and Agulhas Currents (n = 72 individuals), central South Atlantic (n = 11), Brazil-Malvinas confluence region (n = 8), northwest Atlantic (n = 4) and Canary Current (n = 5). Estimated proportion of time spent in each area by the whole adult population is shown in white panels. Note that the Canary Current includes all breeding positions as well as the few wintering ones.

Ramos.\n          \n          \n        \n        Each year since the 1978 breeding season, new individuals found nesting at study sites within the colony and all their chicks were ringed with a monel band. The presence/absence of each ringed individual in the colony was recorded annually from 1978 by consecutive burrow visits during early incubation (early June). The analysed dataset is composed by (1) a continuous period of 22 years monitoring data (from 1978 to 1999) from a sample of ca. 500 individually numbered nests (3,227 individuals), and, (2) a period of eight years (from 2004 to 2011) coming from a different sample of 358 numbered nests (1,330 individuals), with no data collected in-between.\n      \n        Tracking Data\n        Additionally, to choose the most appropriate and relevant environmental predictors for Cory’s shearwater survival, we first characterized the phenology and annual distribution of birds breeding at Selvagem Grande Island. We tracked their trans-equatorial migrations by deploying leg-mounted 3.6-g geolocators (mk7 model, developed by British Antarctic Survey, [46]) at the end of breeding seasons 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (August/September). In the beginning of the following breeding seasons (April/June), we recovered complete data from 100 geolocators. Geolocators provide two positions per day based on light levels (one at local midday and other at local midnight), with an accuracy of approximately 186±114 km [47]. Data were analysed using TransEdit (to check for integrity of light curves and to fit dawn and dusk times; [46]) and Birdtrack software (to estimate the latitude from day length and longitude from the time of local midday relative to Greenwich Mean; [46]). We assumed a sun elevation angle of −4.5 degrees, based on known positions obtained during ground-truthing of loggers carried out before and after deployment. Unrealistic positions (those resulting from interference of light curves at dawn or dusk, or around equinox periods) were removed from the analyses.\n      \n        Environmental and Fishery Data\n        We chose a series of climatic and fishery-related indices with biological interest for Cory’s shearwaters to explore their relationship with adult survival (Table 1). We extracted monthly values of all indices specifically for the Canary Current (20°–35°N, 10°–20°W) to evaluate their effect on the breeding ground, and for the Benguela (15°–40°S, 5°–25°E) and Agulhas (15°–40°S, 25°–45°E) Currents to assess their impact on the non-breeding grounds as described by tracking data (Fig. 1 and Appendix S1). In order to integrate the breeding and non-breeding periods separately, we averaged monthly data over April-September and December-February, respectively.\n        10.1371/journal.pone.0040822.t001Table 1\n            Questions addressed concerning the impact of fisheries and climate on Cory’s shearwater survival.\n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Question of interest\n                Covariate response in the breeding ground\n                Covariate response in wintering grounds\n                Potential effect on survival\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                Are longline fisheries having an impact on survival?\n                LLCC\n                LLBA\n                Direct, negative\n              \n              \n                Is SST affecting shearwater survival?\n                SSTCC\n                SSTBA\n                Indirect, positive or negative\n              \n              \n                Does SOI have an impact on its survival?\n                –\n                SOI\n                Direct or indirect, negative\n              \n            \n          \n            \n              \n              LL longlining effort; SST Sea Surface Temperature; SOI Southern Oscillation Index; subindex CC Canary Current; subindex BA: Benguela and Agulhas Currents.\n            \n            \n              \n              Note that specific covariate responses (longlining activity: LL, sea surface temperature: SST, and Southern Oscillation Index: SOI) in breeding and wintering grounds were tested. Potential effects of these covariates on survival were also predicted as direct when the covariate in itself influences survival, indirect when it is though a trophic cascade effect for instance, positive when the effect of the covariate increases survival probability, and negative when that effect damages survivorship.\n            \n          \n        In most cases, fishery-related indices are expected to affect directly adult survival, with longlining affecting negatively seabirds through incidental bycatch (e.g. [48], [49]). In particular, foraging areas exploited by Cory’s shearwater both in breeding and wintering periods are thought to largely overlap with areas frequented by longlining fishery vessels [38], [50], [51]. Thus, we tested the effect of longlining effort (LL) by extracting the number of hooks used by tuna longliners in specific areas and seasons (Appendix S1). Longlining data was obtained from International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) website (http://www.iccat.es/en/accesingdb.htm), which offers small scale (5°×5° squares) monthly catch and fishing effort indices.\n        Climatic fluctuations are also suspected to affect seabird mortality either directly through storminess (e.g. [34]), or after a temporal lag through an indirect mechanism (e.g. [52]), where climate first affects primary production, and then integrates along the trophic web up to top predators [53]. Firstly, we explored potential effects of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI, available at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/correlation/soi.data), which reflects El Niño/La Niña large-scale oscillations through changes in sea level pressure between the south-eastern and south-western Pacific waters. Although the effect of the SOI is most pronounced in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean, other southern marine ecosystems such as the Southern Atlantic where most Cory’s shearwaters winter seem also affected by sustained positive SOI values (i.e. La Niña episodes; [54]). Secondly, we tested a local index, the Sea Surface Temperature (SST, available at http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk_ATOM_dataent_hadisst, at 1° spatial resolution, HadISST 1.1; Hadley Centre, British Atmospheric Data Centre), which provides information on oceanographic conditions on a finer geographical scale and which may ultimately structure the trophic web. Finally, we considered both SOI and SST variables lagged one (breeding to non-breeding, or vice versa), two (i.e. one entire year), three or even four seasons (see Appendix S1 for details). By these means, we investigated the potential long-lasting effects of these environmental variables through the whole trophic web on survival.\n        To reduce the number of explanatory variable and avoid spurious relationships (errors of type I, [55]), we either combined correlated variables of the same nature (i.e. units) by averaging all respective months (e.g. SST in the breeding ground for four consecutive seasons and SOI for the non-breeding and the previous breeding seasons) or we performed a Principal Component Analyses (PCA) when the correlated variables were of a different nature (e.g. LL with all SST in the non-breeding grounds). We retained the first and second PCs for that last synthetic covariate (denoted by PC1LLSST and PC2LLSST, respectively) which accounted for 47.7% and 28.8% of the variation of the four original covariates, respectively. This reduced set of six variables is detailed in Appendix S1.\n      \n        Demographic Modelling\n        Demographic parameters were estimated with capture-mark-recapture (CMR; [56]) models, using M-Surge version 1.8 [57] and a total of 4,555 adult capture-recapture histories, over the 1978–2011 period. We started with the Cormarck-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model where survival (Φ, probability that a shearwater alive at year t survives at year t+1) and capture (p, probability that a shearwater alive and present at the breeding colony at year t is caught during the year t) were time (t) and group (sex) dependent. The fit of the general model to the data was investigated with goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests for each period (1978–99 and 2004–11) and sex using program U-Care version 2.2 [58]. Model selection was done using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size and overdispersion (QAICc; [59]). When comparing two models, if ΔQAICc >2, the preferred model is the one with the smallest QAICc value (i.e. the most parsimonious model in terms of the number of parameters and model deviance; [56]). Along the modelling, capture probability was fixed to zero for the period 2000–2003 in all the individuals, and for the period 2004–2011 in those individuals sampled during the first period (i.e. 1978–1999) to account for changes in the monitoring protocol over the course of the study. To test and evaluate the impact of (uncorrelated) climate and fishery covariates on adult survival, we progressively built models from the best time dependent model including one covariate at a time. We started testing the potential linear effect of longline fisheries (direct mortality) on survival and we then tested for linear and non-linear (quadratic) effects of the climate on seabird demography. We also tested whether the impact of each of these covariates was constant over the entire period 1978–2011 (one slope) or whether it differed between 1978–1999 and 2004–2011 periods (two slopes). By doing so, we aimed to disentangle whether these variables had changed their potential effect between the two considered periods. The ability of each covariate to describe significant variation in survival was assessed using analysis of deviance tests (ANODEV: F-test statistic with ncov and n-ncov-1degrees of freedom, where ncov represented the number of covariates included and n was the number of parameters of the time dependent model; [60]) and the effects of these covariates were quantified using an approximated R2statistic [61]: R2 = DEV(Mcst)-DEV(Mcov)/[DEV(Mcst)-DEV(Mt)], where DEV(Mcst), DEV(Mcov) and DEV(Mt) are the respective deviances for the models constant, with covariate(s) and time dependent. While modelling the effect of the covariates, Mcst were selected according to the aim of the test (see Table 3 for details).\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006721/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006721/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040822/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053126/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053126/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053126/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102370","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nPreviously reported findings in Austrian BRCA1/2 mutation carriers suggested a possible dependency of embryos with BRCA1/2 mutations on so-called low alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, characterized by less than 26 CGG repeats (CGGn<26). The hypothesis arose from a study reporting highly statistically significant enrichment of low FMR1 alleles, significantly exceeding low allele prevalence in a general population, suggesting embryo lethality of BRCA1/2 mutations, “rescued” by presence of low FMR1 alleles. Such a dependency would also offer an explanation for the so-called “BRCA-paradox,” characterized by BRCA1/2 deficient embryonic tissues being anti-proliferative (thereby potentially causing embryo-lethality) but proliferative in malignant tumors, including breast and ovarian cancers. Follow up investigations by other investigators, however, at most demonstrated trends towards enrichment but, mostly, no enrichment at all, raising questions about the original observation and hypothesis. We in this study, therefore, investigated CGGn of the FMR1 gene of 86 anonymized DNA samples from women with various forms of ovarian cancer, and were unable to demonstrate differences in prevalence of low FMR1 alleles either between positive and negative ovarian cancer patients for BRCA1/2 or between ovarian cancer patients and reported rates in non-cancer populations. This raises further questions about a suggested dependency between BRCA1/2 and FMR1, but also raises the possibility that investigated Austrian BRCA1/2 carrier populations differ from those in other countries. Either only selected BRCA1/2 mutations, therefore, interact with low FMR1 alleles or the Austrian data reflect only coincidental observations.\n"],"title":"Absence of BRCA/FMR1 Correlations in Women with Ovarian Cancers","materials_and_methods":["The study population involved genetic materials from 86 ovarian cancer patients, for who cryopreserved DNA samples were stored at -80°C at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.\nIRB approvals and specimens' origin\nMaterial transfer agreements were executed between the University of British Columbia and the Center for Human Reproduction (CHR) in New York City, and approvals for the studies from both Institutional Review Boards (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, and The Center for Human Reproduction, New York, N.Y.) were separately obtained, including waivers from both IRBs to get individual informed consents from patients who were the source of the genetic materials investigated because samples were coded, before the specimens were shipped overnight on dry ice from Vancouver to New York City. Each specimen contained at least 100 ng of DNA in 5 to 10 uL volume.\n\nIllumina sequencing of CCGn\nThe exonic and limited flanking intronic sequence of BRCA1/2 was determined from peripheral blood derived gDNA following amplification using RainDance technology and Illumina sequencing. The resulting sequences were aligned to the hg19 human genome reference using BWA (both aln and bwasw algorithms), and assembled with ABySS. Variant calling was performed using the samtools mpileup (ABySS, bwasw, and aln) and pindel (aln only) packages. Identified variants were submitted by report to CGL. CGL: Submitted variants were interpreted and annotated using HGVS nomenclature, using reference sequences NM_007294 for BRCA1, and NM_000059 for BRCA2. Pursuant to HGVS convention, cDNA numbering begins at the A of the initiating codon (ATG). Sequences of low coverage regions and ACMG category 1 and 2 mutation variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Centre for Clinical Diagnostic Genomics and further validated at the Cancer Genetics Laboratory (BCCA).\n\nMLPA\nThe presence or absence of copy number differences in BRCA1/2 genes or portions thereof, were determined via Multiplex Ligation-dependant Probe Amplification (MLPA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (P002-C1, P090-A3, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam). Analysis of the resulting amplification products was performed using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer and associated analysis software. Large scale insertions and deletions which lie outside the regions assessed by the individual MLPA probes are not detectable by this method. Genetic variants lying within individual probe binding sites may lead to false positive MLPA results. Single exon deletions are independently confirmed. BRCA1 reference sequence: NM_007294. BRCA2 reference sequence NM_000059.\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by MRC-Holland (Amsterdam). Furthermore, this test kit is labeled “For Research Purposes Only.”\nSpecimens were initially shipped anonymized with identifier codes. Once FMR1 testing results had been obtained, clinical information in regards to each sample was forwarded from Vancouver to New York, which included BRCA1 and BRCA2 status, type of ovarian malignancy and stage of disease.\nOnce specimens were received in New York, they were immediately stored at −80°C until assayed by commercial assay for CGGn of the FMR1 gene (LabCorp, Burlington, North Carolina), as previously reported [3]. In short, no interpretable results were obtained in 6/86 submitted samples, leaving 80 ovarian cancer patients in the study for analysis. CGGn was reported for both alleles. Individual mutations were described as previously reported based on a normal CGGn range of 26–34. Alleles below CGGn = 26 were, therefore, considered low [3]. Women with both alleles in normal range are considered normal (norm); those with one allele in normal and one outside normal range are heterozygous (het) and those with both alleles outside normal range are homozygous (hom). Genotypes are then further sub-divided into sub-genotypes based on low or high (CGGn>34) alleles.\nWe then established the prevalence of low FMR1 alleles for the whole ovarian cancer group and compared it to control populations without known malignancies, previously reported in the literature. In a second analysis we then compared the prevalence of low FMR1 alleles in ovarian cancer patients, either with or without BRCA1/2 mutations. And, in addition, repeated the analysis only for functionally oncogenic BRCA1/2 mutations.\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics version 21. Continuous variables were expressed a means ± standard deviation. Categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentage).

Lack of vitamin-B12 (VB12) and / or folate (Vitamin-B9, VB9) with elevated homocysteine is the key factor responsible for megaloblastic anemia. Prior studies have demonstrated the induction of apoptosis in these abnormal under-developed erythrocytes. However, it is not clear whether this apoptosis induction is due to elevated p53 level or due to any other mechanism. Furthermore, it is also not fully known whether decreased vitamin-B12 and / or folate are responsible for apoptosis induction mediated by p53 in pre-erythroblasts. Methods: Levels of serum VB9, VB12 and homocysteine in 50 patients suffering from MBA were compared with 50 non-megaloblastic anemia control subjects, who were referred by the clinicians for bone marrow examination for medical conditions other than MBA. Next, we have measured the p53 expression in the paraffin embedded blocks prepared from bone marrow biopsy, using immunohistochemistry, and the expression levels correlated with VB9 and VB12 levels. Results: Out of 50 MBA patients 40 (80%) and 44 (88%) subjects had very low VB12 and VB9 levels respectively. In contrast, only 2 (4%) and 12 (24%) non-megaloblastic anemia controls, out of 50 subjects, had low VB12 and VB9 respectively. Correlating with low vitamin B9 and B12, the homocysteine levels were high in 80% cases. But, only 20% non-megaloblastic controls exhibited high homocysteine in plasma. Immunohistochemical analysis for p53 expression showed a significantly high level of expression in MBA cases and no—or very low—expression in control subjects. Our correlation studies comparing the VB12 and VB9 levels with p53 expression concludes unusually high p53 levels in patients suffering from VB12 and VB9 deficiency induced MBA compared to control subjects not suffering from MBA. Conclusion: Tumor protein p53 is the key protein expressed heavily in the bone marrow biopsies of patients suffering from VB12 and VB9 deficiency induced MBA but not in control subjects. Hence, p53 expression could be used as a surrogate marker for confirming the VB9 and VB12 induced MBA.

These subjects are screened by at least three experienced pathologists for the changes in: (a) peripheral blood smear; (b) bone marrow aspirate, and (c) biopsy. In addition, hematological parameters and biochemical parameters (Folate and VitB12) were also assessed while selecting non-megaloblastic control subjects. Based on the above analysis the control subjects are grouped in to: (a) normocytic-normochromic anemia (62%, 31/50); (b) normocytic-normochromic with microcytic hypochromic anemia (24%, 12/50) and (c) microcytic hypochromic anemia (14%, 7/50) (Fig 1a; Tables A, B and C in S1 File). The normocytic normochromic anemia patients were characterized by hemolysis or hemorrhage with normal MCV, MCH and MCHC but low RBC count and hematocrit. The microcytic anemia patients were characterized by small hypochromic red blood cells in a peripheral blood smear with a low MCV (less than 83micron).\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164559.g001\nFig 1\n\nDistribution of control non-megaloblastic anemia participants & Analysis of bone marrow collected from non-megaloblastic anemia controls and megaloblastic anemia cases using Leishman’s staining.\n(a) Analysis of non-megaloblastic anemia control subjects using bone marrow aspirate normocytic-normochromic anemia (62%, 31/50); normocytic-normochromic with microcytic hypochromic anemia (24%, 12/50) and microcytic hypochromic anemia (14%, 7/50) (b) Photomicrographs (at 100X magnification) of Leishman’s stained bone marrow samples collected from control non-megaloblastic anemia and cases with megaloblastic anemia. Bone marrow from control subjects showed normal cellularity with erythroid cells showing—normal maturation (Black arrow),—myeloid series cells and megakaryocytes along with mature neutrophils (Red arrow) and Band forms (Yellow arrow). Megaloblastic anemia cases showed erythroid hyperplastic cells (Pink arrow) and open chromatin (Red arrow). Cells with more cytoplasm (Yellow arrow), giant sized nuclei (metamyelocytes, Black arrow) and band forms (neutrophils, Green arrow) and nuclear hyper segmentation and abnormal maturation (megakaryocytes) were observed only in MBA cases but not in control subjects.\n\n\n\nIdentification of megaloblastic anemia cases: Megaloblastic anemia cases were identified by examining the individuals for characteristic clinical features such as anemia and the symptoms that include glossitis, weakness, fatigue, pallor and neurological manifestations [21,22]. In addition, the selected individuals were subjected to peripheral blood smear reporting that consist of macrocytosis, macro-ovalocytes, basophilic stippling, giants platelet forms, hyper segmented neutrophils, mean corpuscular volume > 100fL [23]. Further, bone marrow aspirate reporting assessing the hyper-cellular bone marrow for erythroid hyperplasia with megaloblasts, giant metamyelocytes band forms, giant megakaryocytes was also considered for recruiting the subjects in this study (Fig 1b). Selected cases were further analyzed for the levels of Vitamin-B9 and B12 using Beckman Coulter Unicel DXI600, and Homocysteine using Randox BIO -02 RX Imola Chemistry Analyzer (Model# OPT790DT). Complete blood count (CBC) in EDTA blood samples were analyzed using Sysmex—XN– 1000 Automated Hematology Analyzer. In brief, ~3ml blood was collected from megaloblastic bone marrow cases and non-megaloblastic control patients in to EDTA containing vacutainer tube and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000rpm in a laboratory centrifuge. The separated plasma was stored at -80°C immediately.\n\nEstimation of Vitamin-B12\nFor analysis of VB12, 10μl plasma was subjected to an automated chemiluminescent two step competitive Immunoassay as described in the product manual [24]. Experimentally, the plasma samples were incubated with mouse anti-Vitamin B12 binding protein, followed by the addition of Vitamin-B12 alkaline phosphatase conjugate and goat anti-mouse capture antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles. After incubation, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-phos* 530 was added to measure Vitamin-B12 levels using a luminometer.\n\n\nEstimation of Folic Acid\nThe folic acid levels in EDTA plasma sample was carried out using a quantitative automated two-step competitive immunoassay method, which uses a mouse anti-Folic Acid binding protein, Folic Acid alkaline phosphatase conjugate and goat anti-mouse capture antibody coupled to paramagnetic particles. The chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-phos* 530 is added to the vessel and the light generated by the reaction was measured with a luminometer.\n\n\nEstimation of Homocysteine\nThe homocysteine concentration in EDTA plasma samples was carried out by enzymatic method using homocysteine estimation kit (Proton PB-HCY-15 and PB-HCY-30). In brief, first, 20μl of EDTA plasma sample was mixed with 20μl reagent-R1 and 200μl reagent-R2. Next, the level of homocysteine was measured in a Randox fully automated analyzer. The test measures homocysteine content in the range of 2.5–80μmol/L.\n\n\nPreparation of bone marrow biopsy paraffin embedded blocks for immunohistochemical analysis\nParaffin blocks for immunohistochemical staining were prepared by first incubating the bone marrow biopsy specimens in 10% formalin for about 16h, followed by the decalcification using 10% EDTA treatment for 2–3 days [25]. Next, the EDTA was removed by washing the specimens thoroughly in running water, and subsequently processed using automated tissue processer (Thermo Scientific, Shandon Citadel-2000) as described below\n\nDehydration with 70% alcohol for 60 min followed by treatment with (a) 90% alcohol for 45 min (b) absolute alcohol for 45 min (2 times) and (c) absolute alcohol for 60 min.\nThe dehydrated blocks were treated with xylene for 60 min (3 times) followed by infiltration with paraffin wax for 30min, 60min and90 min.\nAt this point the blocks were ready for embedding using paraffin wax.\nOnce prepared, the paraffin blocks were sectioned using microtome—Leica RM 2255 to obtain 4μm thick sections. The sections were heat fixed on poly-L Lysine coated slides using a hot plate. The slides, thus prepared, were ready for immunohistochemical staining.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of tissue sections was carried out by the following procedure described in the product manual. First, the slides were deparaffinized with xylene (3 washes for 2–3 min) and hydrated using a graded alcohol series (2–3 min each). The hydrated slides were washed in running water and subjected to staining with p53 antibody (PathnSitu). In brief, first, the antigens were retrieved using EDTA buffer (10mM Tris Base, 0.37% EDTA, 0.5% Tween-20 and pH9.0) under steam pressure for 15 minutes followed by allowing the solution to cool for 10 minutes. Next, antigen retrieved slides were washed with TBS buffer (0.5M Tris Base, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20 and pH7.5–8.0) for 5 minutes and blocked with PolyExcel H2O2 for 5min. The peroxide blocked slides were washed once again with TBS buffer for 5 minutes and incubated with p53 primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed by washing with TBS buffer for 5 minutes and treated with PolyExcel Target Binder for 10min at room temperature. After washing with TBS buffer for 5 minutes the tissue sections were covered with PolyExcel PolyHRP conjugate for 10min at room temperature. At this point the slides washed once again with TBS buffer for 5minutes and a PolyExcel StunnDAB working solution was added. Next, the slides were allowed to stand for 5min at room temperature. These slides were washed with TBS buffer for 5minutes and stained with Hematoxylin (30 sec. at room temperature). Excess hematoxylin was removed by washing with tap-water and the slides dried by dehydrating through graded alcohols and xylenes. The dried slides were observed under Olympus BX-53 microscope, equipped with Olympus XC-10 camera. Two certified pathologists independently examined the slides and scored for the expression of p53. As suggested by supplier, the breast carcinoma tissue having wild type p53 was used as a control for positive staining while tissue from colon, not expressing p53, served as a negative control.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the results were subjected to statistical calculations usingStatistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Linear association between two groups such as VB9 and VB12 levels with p53 expression among controls and cases was determined using Pearson's correlation of coefficient. The level of significance between two groups (such as Folic acid/Vitamin-B12/Homocysteine between control and cases) was determined using Kruskal-Wallis test.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053125/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090027/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164559/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164559/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164559/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127454/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127454/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127454/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127454/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115015/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102369/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015968/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053124","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Military training generates frequent and irregular disturbance followed by succession, resulting in fine-scaled mosaics of ecological conditions in military training areas (MTAs). The awareness that MTAs may represent important biodiversity sanctuaries is increasing recently. Concurrently, changes in military doctrine are leading to abandonment of many MTAs, which are being brought under civilian administration and opened for development. We surveyed vascular plants in 43 and butterflies in 41 MTAs in the Czech Republic and compared the records with plants and butterfly records from 301 and 125 nature reserves, respectively. After controlling for effects of area, geography, and climate, we found that plant species richness was equal in the two land use categories; butterfly richness was higher in MTAs; reserves hosted more endangered plants and more endangered butterflies. Ordination analyses, again controlled for potential nuisance effects, showed that MTAs and reserves differed also in species composition. While specialist species of nationally rarest habitat types inclined towards the reserves, MTAs hosted a high representation of endangered species depending on either disturbed ground, or successionaly transient conditions. These patterns reflect the history of the national nature reserves network, and the disturbance-succession dynamics within MTAs. The conservation value of formerly army-used lands is increasingly threatened by abandonment, and conservationists should support either alternative uses mimicking army activities, or sustainable management regimes.\n      "],"title":"Conservation Potential of Abandoned Military Areas Matches That of Established Reserves: Plants and Butterflies in the Czech Republic","materials_and_methods":["\n        Reserves and Military Areas\n        In addition to national parks, the Czech Republic protected areas system includes about 2000 smaller locations in several categories of legal protection, collectively coined here as reserves. The main division is between the National reserves, viewed as the most valuable ones and administered by the central government (n = 221); and Regional reserves, administrated by local governments.\n        The military-administered lands include five large training ranges, each covering hundreds of km2 (not considered here); and approximately 200 smaller MTAs, none exceeding 1000 hectares, 60 of which were historically used by armoured units. While some of these smaller MTAs have existed since the 19th century, the majority of them were established in the years preceding, or shortly following, World War II, and all the studied ones were abandoned in the 1990s.\n      \n        Taxa Studied\n        Czech Republic flora is made up of approximately 2750 taxa of vascular plants [26]; the number is higher if ornamental plants, apomictic and critical taxa etc., are included. The national Red list [27] contains 1543 endangered taxa, ca. 60% of the flora.\n        For butterfly analysis, we merged butterflies proper (Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea), and day-active burnet moths (Zygaenidae). A total of 165 species of these groups currently occur in the country (144 butterflies, 21 burnet moths), of which 84 (76, 8) are considered endangered [28].\n      \n        The Data\n        \n          Plants in reserves\n          The data originated from reserve inventories, commissioned by the Czech Conservation Authority in the late 1990s. Skilled botanists, usually familiar with assigned sites, were asked to record as many as possible vascular plants species per reserve. A total of 301 thus surveyed reserves (Table 1, Fig. 1, Table S1) represent a sample of the Czech Republic reserve network balanced with respect to reserve areas, geographic locations or original conservation targets (e.g., vegetation, endangered species); see [29] for data acceptance criteria.

Targeting butterflies, reserves protecting homogeneous woodlands expectably poor in butterflies were underrepresented at the expense of grasslands. Each reserve was assigned to a lepidopterist, who visited it five times between May and September, always under suitable weather, each time checking all biotopes present and following an approximately identical path, but paying particular attention to seasonally changing locations of such butterfly resources as nectar [31]. Visit durations scaled with reserve area (<25 ha: 1 h, <50 ha: 1.5 h, <100 ha: 3 h, <200∶4 h, above 200 ha: 5 h).\n        \n        \n          Plants in military areas\n          The 42 medium-sized MTAs surveyed constitute all such sites that were historically used by armoured army units, and until now were not completely build-up, afforested, or turned to arable land. They are distributed evenly across the country (Fig. 1) and in terms of area and altitude, they are more homogeneous than the reserves surveyed for plants and butterflies (Table 1). Species lists were compiled during intensive surveys by two botanists in summer 2008, visit durations again scaled with area (<25 ha: 3h, <50 ha: 4 h, <100 ha: 8 h, <200 ha: 10 h, <200 ha: 12 h) and covered all habitat types present in each site.\n        \n        \n          Butterflies in military areas\n          Following the identical procedure as for butterflies in reserves, 41 sites were inventoried in 2008.\n        \n      \n        Variables and Analyses\n        Plant (species) richness, Endangered plants, Butterfly (species) richness, and Endangered butterflies were response variables, whereas site STATUS – Reserve vs. MTA – was the main factor of interest.\n        To compare the species richness patterns, we employed a regression approach aiming on statistically controlling confounding effects of unequal sample sizes and the sites’ geographic position, area and climate on the response variables. For each site, we considered the following readily available characteristics, likely influencing local species richness: Area; Latitude (Lat); Longitude (Long) and Altitude (Alt), all standing for geography patterns affecting species’ distributions; Altitude range (ARang), a proxy of topographic and mesoclimatic heterogeneity; and Phytogeography region (Veg), based on the division of the Czech territory into thermophyticum, mesophyticum and oreophyticum, according to a combination of topography and climate. We coded Veg as a 3-levelled ranked variable, expecting the highest species richness in the warmest thermophyticum [29].\n        Using the generalised linear modelling in R [32] and assessing the models following the information theory approach (AIC values), we first ran single-predictors’ tests with STATUS against the four response variables. We then computed, separately for each response, single-terms’ regressions with all possible covariables, including their second-degree polynomials, to check the directions and strengths of the responses. Next, we constructed fully saturated models containing all potential covariables (in the forms suggested by the single-term tests) and their interactions (up to 2nd-order). We simplified these models using the R backward-elimination procedure, until we obtained minimal adequate models (MAMs) containing only predictors that improved the respective models fits without introducing unnecessary complexity. MAMs thus represented the best explanations of the response variable distribution using the covariables considered, and hence a maximum possible statistical control for the covariables’ nuisance effects. Finally, we added the categorical predictor STATUS onto the MAMs, and compared these MAM-STATUS models with MAM models. If MAM-STATUS and MAM differed by ΔAIC ≤2.0, we considered it as improving the fit. These comparisons assessed the effect of reserve vs. military area on response variable after considering the effects of all covariables.\n        Plant richness, Endangered plants and Butterfly richness data were analysed with the Gaussian distribution of errors, following logarithmic (Plant richness, Endangered plants) and square-root (Butterfly richness) transformations. Endangered butterflies data were modelled with the Poisson error distribution.\n        We subsequently repetated the entire regression procedure for a subsample of reserves with areas (20–355 ha) and altitudes (150–650 m) matching those of the MTAs. This provided a more direct comparison between reserves and MTAs that were comparable natural conditions. Total of 97 reserves fulfilled the selection criteria for plants, 47 reserves fulfilled them for butterflies (Table 1).\n        To compare the reserves and MTAs with respect to species composition, we used Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), a unimodal ordination method that relates the species composition of samples to the samples’ environmental characteristics. We carried out the analyses in CANOCO for windows [33], using the Monte Carlo tests (999 permutations under reduced model) to asses the significance of ordination results. Individual localities were samples in these analyses, species records formed the species data matrix. As in the regressions, we first related the species composition to STATUS only. Second, to account for variation in environmental conditions, we built covariate models based on forward selection of site characteristics, their polynomial terms and second-degree interactions. Finally, again following the procedures used for the univariate regressions, we tested for the partial STATUS significance after including the forward-selected covariate terms onto the models, thus asking if STATUS explained some additional variation in species composition of the samples.\n        To interpret the ordination results, we used a simple metrics, the relative representation of endangered species among the species most tightly associated with extreme of the canonical axis, i.e. with reserves vs. MTAs, in the CCA models containing STATUS and covariates. For plants, we considered 100 species at each side of the gradient, i.e., 100 species most tightly associated with reserves and 100 species most tightly associated with MTAs; these 200 species corresponded to 10 percent of plant species analysed (cf. Table 1). For butterflies, with considerably fewer species in total, we considered the upper and lower quartiles along the canonical axis (or 50% of all species analysed), amounting 38 species at each side.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090026","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nThe large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, shows a seasonal polyphenism of wing melanisation, spring individuals being darker than summer individuals.

We tested the relationships between thermal reaction norm of wing melanisation and adult lifespan as well as female fecundity.

We found a low heritability in wing melanisation (h2 = 0.18). Rearing families had contrasted thermal reaction norms. Adult lifespan of males and females from highly plastic families was shorter in individuals exposed to hot developmental temperature. Also, females from plastic families exhibited lower fecundity. We did not find any effect of maternal or grand-maternal developmental temperature on fitness.

Optimum temperature for development seems to be between 20°C and 26°C [41]. Moreover, a pilot experiment with F9 individuals showed that larvae reared above 26°C and below 18°C experienced high mortality (>90%). Larvae were separated in familial groups of thirty individuals. They were reared on cabbage, Brassica oleracea provided ad libitum, in 15*9*9 cm boxes under a constant light cycle (Light : Dark 14∶ 10 h) that induces direct development without pupal diapause. Temperature, light brightness and hygrometry were controlled daily within each climate rooms (POL-EKO ST500), using the same thermometer, hygrometer and light meter, and the only significant difference we observed between the rooms was the temperature (which is the manipulated variable here). Rearing boxes with caterpillars were moved from their position in a climate room every day to avoid a position effect in the room. After emergence, imagoes were placed in 60*60*60 breeding cages, at 25°C ±1°C with unrelated individuals, where their survival was recorded daily. Mating pairs were isolated in 20*20*20 cm laying cages to produce the next generation (F2). Every day, the eggs laid by each female on cabbage leaves were counted before splitting them over the three temperature treatments. Eggs from the same clutches were full siblings as females could mate only once. The number of offspring at each developmental stage was also recorded. We used the same protocol to produce the next generation (F3). The developmental temperature of F1 and F2 generations was manipulated in order to test the importance of maternal and grand-maternal effects on F3 generation, while the developmental temperature of F3 generation was manipulated to test potential costs of phenotypic plasticity.\n\nPicture Acquisition and Processing\nWe developed a system to take standardised digital photography of living imagoes after their emergence. Each individual was photographed on the day of its emergence in order to limit wing attrition effect on colouration and area of wing. Butterflies were anaesthetized with nitrogen monoxide using an Inject+Matic Sleeper TAS and held between two transparent plastic pieces. The butterfly was then placed into a light tent on a standard white background. The tent diffused homogeneous and constant light from two lamps on both sides. Grey reflectance standards were included in pictures at the start of a photography session [42]. A decimeter arranged under the butterfly allowed us to control the scale of each photograph. The digital camera was placed on a tripod and in a dark room at a distance of 30 cm from the butterfly. We used a Nikon D300 digital camera equipped with a 105 mm macro lens. The shutter lag time was 10 seconds to impede vibrations. We manually set the white balance according to the light intensity and we maintained a constant integration time and a constant lens aperture [42].\nThe left and the right forewings were extracted from the digital picture (4288×2488 pixels) with the Gimp shareware (http://gimp.org/), and wing variables were measured with the ImageJ shareware (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The total areas of the right and left forewing of each individual were measured. Melanised areas had a grey reflectance score above the threshold of 120 (where 0 = white, 255 = black). This threshold reliably separated melanised from unmelanised scales on the wings according to the grey reflectance standards [36]. Based on a subsample of 30 individuals, wing measures were highly repeatable (99% of the variation in repeated measurements, including repeated photographing, is due to between individual variations).\n\nInheritance of Wing Melanisation\nA total of 829 butterflies (403 males and 426 females) on 3 000 harvested eggs over three generations were photographed. Adult size was estimated by averaging the area of left and right forewings (i.e. ‘size’ variable). Total black area was also averaged over both forewings for each side (i.e. ventral and dorsal, see Figure 1). As ventral melanised area was correlated with dorsal melanised area (Pearson’s correlation test, r2 = 0.87, t = 51.21, df = 827, p<0.0001), we used dorsal melanised area for subsequent analyses.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090026.g001Figure 1\nDorsal wings of female (a) and male (b) Pieris brassicae.\nThe colouration of ventral wings is the same for both sexes; a female is shown here (c). Total black areas of dorsal and ventral forewings were measured.\n\nWe estimated wing melanisation heritability from the pedigree data (829 butterflies over 3 generations) fitting animal models with the R package MCMCglmm [43]. The animal model is a mixed-effect model that allows assessing the genetic and non genetic components of phenotypic variation. Individuals’ pedigree is included as an explanatory random variable to estimate genetic variance. This approach allowed to partition the additive genetic variance (animal effect), the variance due to maternal effects, and the residual environmental variance of melanisation. The forewing melanised area constituted the response variable. Forewing area and sex were treated as fixed effects and animal effect (pedigree), rearing temperature, mother temperature and grand-mother temperature were treated as random effects. The MCMC chains were run for 1 300 000 iterations with a burn-in period of 300 000 to ensure satisfactory convergence [44]. Parameters, estimated standard errors and confidence intervals were performed by sampling 1 000 times the posterior parameter distribution. The deviance information criterion (DIC) was used for model selection. The difference between DIC-values of two competing models should not exceed 10 [45]. Adding a random effect ‘rearing box’ nested in the animal effect did not improve the models, and we thus excluded this effect from the models.\n\nWing Melanisation Plasticity\nFor analyses of wing melanisation plasticity we used the offspring of 9 females (9 families, 585 individuals) from the F3 generation. Thereby we measured wing melanisation plasticity at the family level. As estimators of phenotypic plasticity, we considered: (i) the variance of melanin proportion (i.e. the ratio between dorsal melanised area and total wing area) between temperatures, and (ii) the absolute slope of the linear regression between the melanin proportion and temperature in each family. We used the absolute slope of the reaction norm, as we were interested in the magnitude of the variation, and the direction of the variation was indicated by a supplementary binary variable (i.e. the ‘slope sign’).\nWe tested the effect of wing melanisation plasticity for dorsal forewings on adult lifespan, using linear mixed effect models (LME) with sex, melanin proportion, rearing temperature, rearing cage, rearing temperature of the mother and the grand-mother, mating status and first order interactions as supplementary fixed effects, and family as a random effect. The mating status, hereafter called ‘mate’ indicates whether an individual mated or not. This variable is known to negatively affect adult lifespan due to an energetic cost [46], [47]. The melanin proportion was added to models in order to verify that lifespan was influenced by melanin plasticity and not by individual melanisation only. We performed a model selection approach using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, [48]) and a model averaging procedure. Akaike weights (Wi) that represent the relative probability for a model i to be the best among considered models, were calculated for the subset of models having (AICbest −AICi) ≤2. In a model averaging procedure, averaged parameters and their corresponding unconditional standard errors were calculated from the smallest subset of AIC-ranked models for which ∑Wi was ≥0.95. The relative importance of each variable within the averaged model was estimated by adding Wi-values of those models within the 95% confidence set containing that variable [48]–[50].\nWe tested the effect of wing melanisation plasticity on female fecundity (30 females from F3 generation) using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with the number of hatching eggs as response variable, and wing melanisation plasticity, melanin proportion, rearing temperature, rearing temperatures of the mother and the grand-mother, female lifespan and their interactions as fixed effects, and family as a random effect. The number of hatching eggs was analyzed using a quasi-Poisson error and a logarithmic function link (a Poisson GLM correcting for overdispersion [51]). As in quasi-Poisson models, the AIC is not defined, we performed analysis of deviance to compare two nested models (full and nested models [52]). The best model was obtained by stepwise deletion of non significant terms (p>0.05). No transformations of response variables were needed to meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 2.11.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102368","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing severe respiratory illness in infants and immune compromised patients. The ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium have been considered to be the exclusive target of RSV, although recent data have suggested that basal cells, the progenitors for the conducting airway epithelium, may also become infected in vivo. Using either mechanical or chemical injury models, we have demonstrated a robust RSV infection of p63+ basal cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, proliferating basal cells in 2D culture were also susceptible to RSV infection. We therefore tested the hypothesis that RSV infection of this progenitor cell would influence the differentiation status of the airway epithelium. RSV infection of basal cells on the day of seeding (MOI≤0.0001), resulted in the formation of an epithelium that showed a profound loss of ciliated cells and gain of secretory cells as assessed by acetylated α-tubulin and MUC5AC/MUC5B immunostaining, respectively. The mechanism driving the switch in epithelial phenotype is in part driven by the induced type I and type III interferon response that we demonstrate is triggered early following RSV infection. Neutralization of this response attenuates the RSV-induced loss of ciliated cells. Together, these data show that through infection of proliferating airway basal cells, RSV has the potential to influence the cellular composition of the airway epithelium. The resulting phenotype might be expected to contribute towards both the severity of acute infection, as well as to the longer-term consequences of viral exacerbations in patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases.\n"],"title":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Can Infect Basal Cells and Alter Human Airway Epithelial Differentiation","materials_and_methods":["\nCells and viruses\nHuman bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were purchased from Lonza and expanded in Bronchial Epithelial cell Growth Medium (BEGM) supplemented with the recommended additives (Singlequots, Lonza) until 80% confluent (P0 cells). Once confluent the cells were aliquoted and frozen down as ‘P1’ cells. For each experiment P1 cells were expanded to 80% confluence and seeded onto a 12-well Transwell permeable support (0.4 µM, Corning, NY) in BEGM media diluted 1∶1 in DMEM (Lonza, Invitrogen) and supplemented with BEGM singlequots devoid of triiodothyronine (T3) and retinoic acid (differentiation media). All trans-retinoic acid (Sigma, 50 nM in ethanol) was added back fresh for each media exchange. Cells were infected by either RSV-A2-GFP [31], [32], or a clinical isolate designated RSV-A2-MOT0972 (Obtained from Edward Walsh, University of Rochester Medical School) at various multiplicity of infection (MOI), as indicated in the text. Six days post-seeding the media was removed from the apical side and cells were cultured at ALI for an additional 14 days. Media was replaced three times a week with 1 mL on the basal side and for week one, 400 µL was added on the apical side.\n\nRSV quantification\nRSV-A2-GFP was grown in HEp-2 cells and purified by centrifugation through sucrose. Briefly, cells were infected with RSV at an MOI of 0.05. Ninety-six hours post-infection the cells were scraped into the media, which was collected and vortexed to release cell-associated viral particles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded onto a 20% sucrose cushion in PBS and purified by centrifugation at 11,500 g. Pelleted virus was re-suspended in PBS containing 25% sucrose and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of the virus were stored at −80°C. To quantify released virus from infected HBEC, 500 µL of warm DMEM was added to the apical side for 60 min and then collected. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All viral titers were determined by a conventional plaque assay. Ten-fold dilutions of cell supernatant were used to infect HEp-2 cells before overlaying with OptiMEM (Invitrogen) containing: 2% FCS (Invitrogen), 0.8% Methylcellulose (Sigma) and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen). Five days post-infection the cells were fixed with 80% cold methanol for 2 h, rinsed with ddH2O and blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS. RSV infected cells were stained by RSV-F antibody (Serotec MCA490) followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam). Plaques were visualized by 4CN peroxidase substrate (KPL).\n\nEpithelial denuding\nWell-differentiated HBECs (at 21 days after seeding onto Transwell inserts) were rinsed three times in warm PBS (Invitrogen) to remove mucus. Once cleaned, warm S-MEM media (Invitrogen) was added for 20 min at 37°C (1 mL on the basal side and 500 µL on the apical side). Once separated the suprabasal layer was removed from the basal cell layer by vigorously pipetting up and down. The basal cell layer was washed several times using warm PBS until a single layer of cells could be observed. At this point cells were infected using 100,000 pfu of RSV-A2-GFP.\n\nScratch injury\n100,000 cells were seeded onto a Transwell insert and grown to form a pseudostratified epithelium over 21 days as previously described [11]. Once fully differentiated the cells were washed once from the apical side using warm PBS followed by addition of 500 µL PBS. A GUM stimulator (generic dental tool) was used to carefully scratch several thin scratches that intersected each other. Once scratched 250,000 PFU of RSV-A2-GFP was added in 250 µL of warm HBEC growth media for 30 min at 37°C. After 30 min the apical media was removed, cells incubated at 37°C for 20 h followed by fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde.\n\nFlow cytometry\n100,000 cells were seeded onto a Transwell insert infected 3 h later with RSV-A2-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. Uninfected control cells were incubated with the respective volume of PBS. After 20 h cells where harvested and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rcf and washed once in PBS. Fixed cells were permabilized by PBS+0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at RT, followed by washing once in PBS. Fixed and permabilized cells were stained for p63 (Abcam ab124762) and ITGA6 (Millipore MAB1378) at a dilution of 1∶200 for 45 min, washed once, and incubated with an Alexaflour 568 and Alexaflour 647 conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1∶1000 for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed in PBS using a Fortessa cytometer.\n\nImmunohistochemistry, live cell imaging and cell imaging analysis\nCells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h at 4°C and blocked using 10% horse serum in immunofluorescence buffer containing: 130 mM NaCl, 13 mM Na2HPO4, 3.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween-20 at pH 7.5. All imaging was performed using a Carl Zeiss spinning disk confocal microscope using antibodies against: acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma T6793) to stain ciliated cells, MUC5B (Santa Cruz sc-20119) and MUC5AC (Thermo Scientific MS145P) for secretory cells and p63 (Abcam ab124762) for basal cells. For staining RSV-A2-MOT0972 infected cells a goat anti-RSV antibody was used (Pierce PA1–7240). All Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. To quantify epithelial composition quantitative immunofluorescence was performed by collecting 130 overlapping images at 10x magnification, for each 1 cm2 Transwell insert, in Axiovision 4.8 (Carl Zeiss). This enabled almost the entire surface area of the insert to be captured and used for quantification removing any potential for operator bias. RSV-A2-GFP fluorescence was imaged using the same acquisition protocol. Converted images were analyzed by ImageJ [54] by measuring stained surface area over a pre-defined threshold, using the analyze particles routine. Data was normalized to uninfected control. For confocal microscopy, sections of the inserts were punched out using a 4 mm biopsy punch and mounted on a cover slide using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).\n\nQuantitative PCR\nTotal RNA was harvested and isolated by using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). cDNA was generated by using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All FAM probes were purchased from ABI (Invitrogen) as 20x Master mixes and designed for maximum gene coverage (Table S1). Gene expression reactions were performed with TaqMan 2x PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a ViiA7 Real time PCR cycler (Applied Biosystems). All the data is expressed as expression relative to the untreated control.\n\nELISA\nBasal supernatants were collected at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 post-infection. Uninfected samples were collected at the same time points. Collected supernatant was aliquoted and frozen until assayed for IL-28A or IL-28B/IL-29 production using a sandwich ELISA (R & D Systems). ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IFN content was compared to a 7-point 2-fold dilution standard curve from 8,000 pg/mL or 4,000 pg/mL.\n\nIFN treatment\nSoluble interferons were used at 30 ng/mL for IL-28A (R&D Systems), IL-28B (R&D Systems) and IL-29 (Gibco). For IFN-β (pbl Interferon Source) 2.5 ng/mL was used. Mediator was present in both apical and basal media for week one, and in the basal media once brought to ALI at day 6. Media was replaced three times a week and fresh mediator added. The experiment was terminated after 21 days by fixation using in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained for epithelial composition using antibodies specific to acetylated α-tubulin, MUC5AC and MUC5B.\n\nBlocking of IFN response\nWe used antibodies against IL-28A (R&D Systems at 1 µg/mL), IL-28B/IL-29 (R&D Systems 12.5 µg/mL) and IFN-β (R&D Systems at 2 µg/mL) to neutralize the induced IFN response. Concentrations used had been verified to neutralize an induced IFN response in A549 cells to at least 50% (Figure S4). All treatments were performed as combination treatment or individual with matched isotype control. One week after seeding the media was removed from the apical side and cells were allowed to differentiate. Mediator was present in both apical and basal media for week one. The antibody treatment continued for the full 21 days. At day 21 cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for epithelial composition using antibodies specific to MUC5AC and acetylated α-tubulin.\n\nAnalysis of results\nData are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated. All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad 6 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Significance was assumed when p<0.05.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003556/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003556/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003556/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003556/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053121/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090020/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["Background: Many university students experience high levels of study-related fatigue. This high prevalence, and the negative impact of fatigue on health and academic performance, call for prevention and reduction of these symptoms. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent an exercise intervention is effective in reducing three indicators of study-related fatigue (emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue, and need for recovery). Effects of exercise on secondary outcomes (sleep quality, self-efficacy, physical fitness, and cognitive functioning) were also investigated. Methods: Participants were students with high levels of study-related fatigue, currently not exercising or receiving other psychological or pharmacological treatments, and with no medical cause of fatigue. They were randomly assigned to either a six-week exercise intervention (low-intensity running three times a week, n = 49) or wait list (no intervention, n = 48). All participants were measured before the intervention (T0), and immediately after the intervention (T1). Exercisers were also investigated 4 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the intervention. Results: Participants in the exercise condition showed a larger decrease in two of the three indicators of study-related fatigue (i.e., overall fatigue and need for recovery) as compared to controls. Additionally, sleep quality and some indicators of cognitive functioning improved more among exercisers than among controls. No effects were found for self-efficacy, and physical fitness. The initial effects of the exercise intervention lasted at follow-up (T2 and T3). At 12-week follow up (T3), 80% of participants in the exercise condition still engaged in regular exercise, and further enhancements were seen for emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue, and sleep quality. Conclusions: These results underline the value of low-intensity exercise for university students with high levels of study-related fatigue. The follow-up effects that were found in this study imply that the intervention has the potential to promote regular exercise and accompanying beneficial effects in the longer run. Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register NTR4412 "],"title":"Exercise as an Intervention to Reduce Study-Related Fatigue among University Students: A Two-Arm Parallel Randomized Controlled Trial","materials_and_methods":["Participants were randomly assigned to one of two parallel groups, in a 1:1 ratio. It was investigated whether the exercise intervention was superior to wait list. The study protocol was approved by Ethical Commission Social Sciences of the Radboud University (registration number: ECSW2013-1811-142, see S1 and S2 Protocols). Additionally, the study protocol was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register before recruiting participants (NTR; see http://www.trialregister.nl): NTR4412. In the study protocol it was stated that participation in daily life (social interaction with family, friends, and student networks) would be assessed as well (i.e., secondary outcome). As we did not find a proper measure for this outcome, we preferred to not include this outcome in the current study.\nEligibility criteria\nEligible participants were university students reporting high levels of study-related fatigue, defined by a score above validated cut-off points on two measures of (study-related) fatigue: ≥2.2 on the Emotional Exhaustion Scale of the Utrecht Burnout Scale for Students (UBOS-S; [2, 35]) and ≥ 22 on the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS; [36]). Participants were excluded if at the time of the study screening they a) exercised more than one hour a week; b) received psychological or pharmacological treatment for their fatigue complaints; c) reported a medical cause of their fatigue; d) were addicted to drugs, and e) were physically unable to run.\n\nProcedure\nThe study took place at the Radboud University (The Netherlands) from January 2014 to August 2014. Students were approached through different channels: by short recruitment talks during lectures, the Radboud University’s Research Participation System, social media, and flyers. Those interested in participation could fill out the UBOS (emotional exhaustion) and the FAS (overall fatigue) questionnaires on the study’s website (www.runtervention.nl). If participants scored ≥2.2 on the UBOS, and ≥22 on the FAS, they were asked to answer questions to assess the other criteria for eligibility. If they were eligible to participate, they visited the first author or a research assistant to read and sign informed consent, and to complete other baseline measures. Next, the randomization procedure was conducted.\n\nRandomization\nThe randomization procedure was conducted in a blocked fashion. We planned to deliver the intervention in groups of 10 participants. Of every block of 20 participants, 10 were allocated to the exercise intervention and 10 to the wait list. Participants were given a sealed and opaque envelope with the allocation. After opening the envelope, participants were allowed to tell the researcher in which group they were allocated.\n\nExercise intervention\nThe exercise intervention comprised six weeks in which participants ran three times a week: twice a week in a group of ten people under supervision of a licensed running trainer and once independently (they were allowed to run with others). The running sessions took place outdoors on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6 PM until 7 PM. Participants were instructed to run on a low intensity, in a pace that allowed them to have a conversation during running. The ability to converse during exercise has been shown to match low intensity exercise [37]. Low intensity was chosen because this intensity is preferable for lowering fatigue [23,38], and because it reduces the risk of injuries [39]. In addition, participants were advised to keep at least one day of rest (i.e. no running) in between the running sessions to diminish the risk of injuries. Furthermore, participants were told that the focus during running was not on running as long or as fast as possible, but rather on ‘feeling good’.\nTwo trainers supervised each running group, with each trainer supervising one running session a week. Trainers were all members of the Dutch Foundation of Running Therapy, a foundation focused on offering running to people with psychological complaints (www.runningtherapie-nederland.nl). Trainers had at least two years of experience in giving Running Therapy, and had been trained in psychopathology, physiology, and running training principles. Trainers were instructed to observe participants’ running intensity (i.e. make sure that all participant were able to have a conversation during running) and keep the focus on ‘feeling good’.\nEach running session comprised 60 minutes: a warming up of about 15 minutes (running on a low intensity alternated with walking and flexibility exercises), a core program consisting of running alternated with walking of about 30 minutes, and a cooling down of about 15 minutes. During the six weeks, the periods of running in each running session were extended, and the walking periods shortened, so that after six weeks the participants were able to run 20 minutes uninterrupted on a low intensity.\n\nControl condition\nDuring the six weeks of the exercise intervention, the participants in the control condition were on a wait list and thus received no intervention. After these six weeks, they were given the opportunity to follow the exercise intervention as well.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcomes\nPrimary and secondary outcomes were measured pre (T0), and post (T1) intervention among all participants. Those in the experimental condition were also measured at follow-up: 4 weeks (T2), and 12 weeks after the intervention period (T3). At follow-up, physical fitness was only measured at T3, since 4 weeks constitutes a relatively short time to notice differences in physical fitness [40]. Due to possible learning effects [41], cognitive functioning was not measured at follow-up.\n\nStudy-related fatigue\nStudy-related fatigue was measured with three indicators: emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue and need for recovery. We based the inclusion criteria on the first two indicators only, since a validated cut off score for need for recovery does not exist.\nEmotional exhaustion was measured with a Dutch adaptation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; [42]): Utrecht Burnout Scale [35]. We used a modified version that was especially developed for students (UBOS-S; [2]). From this questionnaire, the ‘Exhaustion’ scale was used, consisting of 5 items, answered on a 7-point Likert scale. An example question is: “I feel burned out from my studies” (0 = never, 6 = always; every day). A mean score was computed. A mean score ≥ 2.2 is considered as ‘high’ emotional exhaustion [35]. Cronbach’s alpha ranged between .81 (T1) and .90 (T4).\nOverall fatigue was measured with the 10-item Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), developed and validated by Michielsen, de Vries & Van Heck [36]. An example question is: “I am bothered by fatigue”. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 = never, 5 = always). A sum score was computed, and a score of ≥ 22 is determined as a ‘high’ level of fatigue [38]. Cronbach’s alphas ranged between .79 (T1) and .88 (T4).\nNeed for recovery was assessed with the 6-item ‘Need for Recovery Scale’ [43]. We adapted the scale for students, meaning that ‘work’ was replaced by ‘study’. An example item is “I find it hard to relax at the end of a day of studying”, and all items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = (almost) never, 4 = (almost) always). A mean score was computed. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from .75 (T1) and .87 (T4).\n\n\nSleep\nTo assess sleep quality, a sum score was computed of six items adapted from the sleep quality scale of the Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of work (VBBA; [44]). The questions tapped into the three main components of insomnia [45]: ‘difficulty initiating sleep’ (1 item, i.e., “I have difficulties falling asleep”), ‘difficulty maintaining sleep’ (2 items, e.g. “I often wake up during the night”), and ‘non-restorative sleep’ (2 items, e.g. “Most of the time, I feel refreshed when I wake up” [reversed]). Furthermore, there was one overall question for sleep quality: “I often sleep well”. All items had a dichotomous answer category: 1 = yes, 0 = no. Positively formulated items were reversed, and a sum score was calculated, so that a higher score indicates more sleep complaints. Cronbach’s alphas ranged between .61 (T1) to .76 (T4). In addition, sleep quantity (mean hours of sleep a night) was questioned.\n\n\nSelf-efficacy\nTo measure self efficacy, the 12-item General Self Efficacy Scale was used (GSES-12; [46]). An example item is: ‘When I make plans, I am certain I can make them work’. A mean score was computed of all items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Cronbach’s alphas ranged between 0.80 (T1) and 0.86 (T2).\n\n\nPhysical fitness\nPhysical fitness was measured with the Conconi test [47]. Although the test received some critics (see [48]), it has been argued that it provides an appropriate indicator of the heart rate deflection point on which physical fitness can be assessed [49]. The test was performed on a stationary cycle ergometer in the Radboud University Sport Centre. Participants wore a heartrate belt, and were instructed to cycle as long as physically possible and to keep their cadence between 70–80 rpm. Before starting the actual test, participants completed a warm-up procedure, consisting of 4 minutes of low-intensity cycling. The start intensity (power—the number of watts) was based on weight and age and thus differed between participants. During the test, the wattage gradually increased, and the time cycling per watt interval gradually decreased. After finishing the test, the heart rate deflection point was determined by the software (e.g. the point at which the heart rate—power relationship deviates from linearity; see [48]). Estimated Vo2max ml/kg/min was based on the heart rate deflection point, the number of watts, age, and gender [47]. Completion of the test took about 20 minutes.\n\n\nCognitive functioning\nCognitive functioning was measured with one self-report measure, and three objective performance tests. These tests measured three types of executive functioning: updating, inhibition, and switching [50].\nSelf-reported cognitive functioning was measured with the Dutch translation of the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; [51]). It consists of 25 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never, 5 = very often), and an example question is: “Do you find you forget appointments?”. A mean score was computed. The reliability of the scale ranged between α = 0.83 (T1) and α = 0.90 (T2).\nUpdating refers to constant monitoring and fast addition/deletion of information in working-memory [52] and was assessed by the 2-Back task [53]. The test consisted of 284 letters that were displayed one-by-one in the centre of a computer screen. The letters were ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘g’, ‘p’, ‘t’, and ‘v’ and were both displayed as capital and small letters. Stimulus duration was set at 450 ms with the interval between two stimuli fixed on 750 ms. Once a letter appeared that was similar to a letter that had appeared two stimuli before, participants had to push a button on a button-box (target rate 32.5%). For a correct response, no distinction was made between capital and small letters. Completion of the test took about seven minutes. The number of correct responses was used as a measure for updating.\nInhibition addresses the suppression of dominant but irrelevant automatic responses to stressors [52] and was measured by the Sustained Attention to Response Test (SART; [54]). A total of 450 digits (ranging from 1–9) were displayed one-by-one in the centre of a computer screen in a random fashion. Participants had to push a button on a button-box each time when they saw a digit, except if the digit was ‘3’ (target rate 11.1%). Digits were displayed for 250 ms and the interval between digits was fixed at 850ms. Completion of the test took about eight minutes. The number of ‘correct inhibitions’ (not pressing the button when a ‘3’ was displayed) constituted the measure for inhibition.\nSwitching refers to the ability of shifting between different tasks [52] and was measured with the Matching task [55]. In each trial of the test, four different geometric figures (circle, hexagon, square and triangle) were displayed in four different colours (blue, green, red and yellow) in the lower half of the screen. Also, a coloured reference geometric figure was shown in the upper half of the screen. The participants had to match the reference figure (in the upper half of the screen) to one of the four figures (in the lower half of the screen) according to shape or colour. The combination between colour and shape figures was presented in such a way that there was one correct answer. Whether participants had to match according to shape or colour, was (randomly) indicated by a cue that was displayed for 1000ms. Participants could push one of the four buttons on a keyboard that corresponded to each of the four match figures in the lower half of the screen. Participants had to push the button as fast as possible. The whole test consisted of 31 task runs, each consisting of on average six trials (range: 4–8 trials). For all the trials during one task run, one cue was given (matching according to shape or colour). During the test, half of all task runs consisted of ‘switch’ runs, in which the type of cue differed from the previous run. The other half consisted of ‘repetition’ runs, in which the type of cue was identical to the previous run. The duration of the test was about six minutes. The reaction time of the first trial of the ‘switch’ or the ‘repetition’ runs was used as a measure for ‘switching’ and ‘repetition’ respectively. Runs in which the cue was not correctly followed or in which no response was given, were not included in the analyses.\nTo obtain a full assessment of cognitive functioning, we additionally explored the subjective costs (fatigue, motivation, demands, and effort) associated with performing the cognitive tests [56–58]. Before doing the cognitive tests, participants rated how motivated they were to do the tests. Fatigue was measured prior to and after the tests. After completing all the tests, participants were asked how demanding the tests had been, and participants indicated how much effort they spent when doing the tests. The subjective costs of doing the cognitive tests were measured by using single item measures, answered on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much).\n\n\nExercise behaviour\nAt T4 (follow-up after 12 weeks), participants in the exercise condition were asked to indicate how frequently and how many minutes a week they exercised in general during the 12-week follow-up period after the intervention.\n\n\nPower analysis\nTo determine the number of participants, a power analysis was conducted in the program G*Power [59]. This analysis was based on a repeated measures MANOVA (RM-MANOVA) with time as within subjects factors and condition as between subjects factor. This analysis showed that a total of 90 participants was required in order to detect a medium effect of .30 (Pillai’s V) on study-related fatigue outcome from pre to the immediate post intervention, given a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%. A comparable previous study showed a medium effect size as well [23]. Because we anticipated a dropout rate of about 20%, we intended to recruit 108 participants. During the study, however, the dropout turned out to be low. Consequently, it was decided to stop recruiting after the number of 100 participants had been reached (five blocks of 20 participants).\n\nStatistical analyses\nWe used SPSS version 19 to analyze the data [60]. The statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle [61]. This means that all participants who were randomized were included in the analyses (i.e., also those who ended their participation before or during the intervention period).\nPearson correlations (r) were used to explore whether the three indicators of study-related fatigue were inter-related. In order to test whether the exercise intervention was effective in reducing these three indicators of study-related fatigue (H1), a RM-MANOVA was conducted with ‘time’ (pre [T0] versus post intervention [T1]) as within-subjects factor and ‘condition’ as between-subjects factor (‘intervention’ versus ‘wait list’). For the effects of the exercise intervention, we were interested in the Group × Time interactions of these RM-(M)ANOVAs, since an interaction indicates that the change in the outcome over time is different between conditions.\nAdditionally, to investigate the extent to which the intervention resulted in clinical meaningful changes [62] in the primary outcomes emotional exhaustion and fatigue, a Chi Square Test was performed to examine if the proportion of participants that were ‘recovered’ at T1 (for burnout: <2.2 on the UBOS; for fatigue: <22 on the FAS) differed between the exercise and the wait list condition. An effect size (φ) between .2–.5 was considered as small, .5–.8 as medium, and >.8 as large [63].\nSeparate repeated measures (M)ANOVAs were done with ‘time’ (pre [T0] versus post intervention [T1]) as within-subjects factor and ‘condition’ as between-subjects factor (‘intervention’ versus ‘wait list’) to investigate the effect of the exercise intervention on sleep (H2a and H2b), self-efficacy (H2c), and physical fitness (H2d). The four indicators of cognitive functioning (H2e), and subjective costs were also separately analyzed by means of a (M)ANOVA. The Matching Task was analyzed using a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed design with ‘run type’ (switch versus repetition) and ‘time’ (pre [T0] versus post intervention [T1]) as within factors and ‘condition’ as between factor (‘intervention’ versus ‘wait list’).\nTo find out whether intervention-effects would persist during the follow-up period (H3a) among participants in the exercise condition (i.e. participants in the control condition were not measured at follow up, because during this period they received the exercise intervention), separate RM-(M)ANOVAs for the outcomes were performed with ‘time’ (pre [T0] vs. post intervention [T1] vs. 4 weeks after the intervention period [T2] vs. and 12 weeks after the intervention period [T3]) as within-subjects factor. Since physical fitness was not measured at T2, the RM-ANOVA for this outcome included three time points (T0, T1, and T3). If the time effect of the RM-(M)ANOVA was significant, post hoc tests were conducted to exactly determine between what time points the outcome had changed. Since Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons is often too conservative, we used the Sidak correction instead [64].\nFor all RM- (M)ANOVAs, an effect size (η2) between .01–.06 was considered as small, .06–.14 as medium, and > .14 as large [65]. Significant interactions effects were further examined by means of paired t-tests, for which Cohen’s d was used as an effect size.\nIn order to investigate whether follow-up effects were moderated by the amount of exercise participants engaged in during the follow-up period (H3b), the amount of exercise during this 12 week follow up period (number of minutes a week) was added as covariate in a RM-(M)ANCOVA with ‘time’ (post intervention [T1] versus follow up after 12 weeks [T3]) as within factor. We were interested in the interaction between the amount of exercise and time, since this indicates that the development over time in a certain outcome is moderated by the amount of exercise participants engage in. The follow up effects at 4 weeks after the intervention (T2) were not taken into account, because exercise was measured as the ‘mean number of minutes a week during the 12 weeks after the intervention’.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152137/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003706/body","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115000","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nMonitoring extracellular matrix (ECM) components is one of the key methods used to determine tissue quality in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for regenerative medicine and clinical purposes. This is even more important when multipotent human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) are used, as it could offer a method to understand in real time the dynamics of stromal cell differentiation and eventually steer it into the desired lineage. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising tool to overcome the challenge of a limited transparency in opaque 3D scaffolds. Technical limitations of MRI involve non-uniform background intensity leading to fluctuating background signals and therewith complicating quantifications on the retrieved images. We present a post-imaging processing sequence that is able to correct for this non-uniform background intensity. To test the processing sequence we investigated the use of MRI for in vitro monitoring of tissue growth in three-dimensional poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)–poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) scaffolds. Results showed that MRI, without the need to use contrast agents, is a promising non-invasive tool to quantitatively monitor ECM production and cell distribution during in vitro culture in 3D porous tissue engineered constructs.\n"],"title":"An Open Source Image Processing Method to Quantitatively Assess Tissue Growth after Non-Invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Seeded 3D Polymeric Scaffolds","materials_and_methods":["\nIsolation of human bone marrow derived stromal cells\nBone marrow aspirates were obtained upon approval of the Medical Ethical committee of the local hospital (Dutch: Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie (MECT) van het Medisch Spectrum Twente) following the Dutch national ethics guidelines from patients who had given written informed consent. Human MSCs from two donors (donor 1: female, age 77; donor 2: female, age 55) were isolated in approval to the local national ethical committee and expanded as described previously [18]. Briefly, aspirates were resuspended using a 20-gauge needle, plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in proliferation medium, which contains minimal essential medium (alpha-MEM; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza), 0.2 mM L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium salt (ASAP, Sigma Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (L—glut, Invitrogen), 100 units/mL penicillin (Life Technologies), 10 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 1 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Instruchemie, Delfzijl, The Netherlands). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Medium was refreshed twice per week and cells were used for further subculturing or cryopreservation on reaching near confluence.\n\nFabrication of PEOT/PBT scaffolds\nScaffolds were fabricated of 300PEOT55PBT45 (PolyActive300/55/45, PolyVation, The Netherlands) which is a block copolymer with a weight ratio of 55 to 45 for the two PEOT and PBT components respectively, and a molecular weight of 300 Da for the PEG segments used in the co-polymerization process. PEOT/PBT copolymers have been extensively studied and proved to be biocompatible in vitro as well as in vivo [19] [20]. Therefore, the material is introduced here as a model material to fabricate biocompatible 3D cell culture scaffolds. Cylindrical porous scaffolds (8 mm in diameter by 3 mm in height) were fabricated as described before [21] by fused deposition modeling with a bioscaffolder (SysENG, Germany) with a fiber to fiber distance of 1000 µm, a fiber diameter of approximately 200 µm, and a layer thickness of 150 µm. These scaffolds were sterilized in 70% ethanol 2 times for 30 minutes each, washed in PBS first for 5 minutes and additionally for other 30 minutes two times, and finally incubated in culture medium overnight prior to cell culture.\n\nCell seeding of PEOT/PBT scaffolds\nScaffolds were dried and transferred to non-treated 24-well plates (NUNC). The hMSCs (passage 3) were harvested from monolayer expansion and suspended in proliferation medium. The scaffolds were seeded with 750,000 hMSCs in 100 µL of medium which was previously shown as an optimal cell density for this scaffold volume to reduce cell loss upon seeding [22]. The cell suspension was gently resuspended on top of the scaffolds to fill all the pores of the scaffold. After 1.5 hour of incubation in the given volume, the medium was filled up to 500 µL. Proliferation medium was replaced twice a week for all samples. Constructs were cultured up to 60 days.\n\nMRI equipment and measurements\nMRI experiments were performed at room temperature on a 14.1 T (600 MHz) Avance II NMR spectrometer from Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany), equipped with a vertical narrow bore magnet, a Great B0 compensation unit, and 3 Great 1/60 amplifier units (X, Y, and Z). A micro 5 imaging probe with a 10 mm diameter saddle coil insert from Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) was used. Images were obtained using a multi-slice-multi-echo (MSME) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)  = 1000 ms, echo time (TE)  = 10 ms, flip angle  = 90°, slice thickness  = 0.07 to 0.1 mm, inter-slice gap  = 0, field of view (FOV)  = 1 cm, and 128×128 or 256×256 matrix. To optimize scanning parameters the first samples were imaged in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after 30 minutes of fixation in 10% formalin. Subsequently, a bare scaffold was immersed in PBS and scanned after degassing as a non-tissue control. This bare scaffold was then incubated in medium prior to cell culture. Additionally, the optimized scanning parameters were applied on this previously scanned scaffold and on other unfixed samples residing in PBS during scanning. To investigate if non-targeted contrast agents can increase the contrast between the solution in which the samples were scanned and the lipids present in the tissue of the sample, one scaffold was imaged before and after addition of Endorem (Guerbet, Villepinte, France). The Endorem solution is comprising superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (11.2 mg/ml) dispersed in water and was added to PBS with a concentration of approximately 0.5% (v/v). The particles are composed of several iron oxide cores (diameter 4–6 nm) embedded inside a dextran coating resulting in an estimated hydrodynamic size of 80–150 nm [23], [24]. The Endorem T2 contrast agent was added to a fixated sample to change the magnetic resonance properties of the solution without inducing cellular uptake.\nTo investigate whether the tissue constructs can be kept in culture after a non-invasive MRI measurement, which is a requirement for longitudinal studies, un-fixated samples were carefully transferred to a sterile MRI tube and imaged in culture media. Subsequently, samples were placed back in the culture plate and culture was continued.\n\nImage processing and quantification\nMRI images were processed in Fiji [25] prior to analysis to correct for non-uniform background intensity and to reduce noise. Background approximations were extracted from the top or bottom slice, where no scaffold and tissue material were present, by performing morphological opening with a disk shaped structuring element (radius 9, Gray Morphology plugin). Background approximations were subtracted from the original image stack to remove the non-uniform intensity. A median filter (pixel radius 2) was applied to the image stacks for noise reduction. After processing, only tissue structures appeared as bright regions, while water and scaffold material showed distinguishably lower intensities, enabling unique identification of constituents of interest. Images were segmented based on a single intensity threshold within a circular region of interest (ROI), comprising scaffold and surrounding water within the MRI glass tubes [26]. Subsequently, morphological opening (pixel radius 2) was applied to smooth the objects and remove outliers. Due to changing overall brightness and intensities between different experiments, the threshold had to be set for each experiment individually. To identify tissue material the threshold was set as such that a bare scaffold, without the presence of cells, showed a limited amount of false positive signal. The retrieved binary images were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The area of the identified objects was computed in a section-by-section (top, middle, bottom) manner to provide insight in the volumetric densities throughout the scaffolds. Per section, the binary images were merged into one 2D projection as a 4-stage look-up table. In this table colors are applied as an indication of the number of slices within the stack, in which each specific pixel in 2D projection was identified as tissue.\nTo quantify the amount of tissue per slice, each slice was converted into a binary image by applying a low threshold-value to identify the pixels representing scaffold material. Subsequently, these pixels identified as scaffold were subtracted from the total amount of pixels within the ROI in that respective slice. Herewith, an indication of available pore volume was retrieved. The amount of tissue was calculated as a percentage of the pixels presenting the available pore volume occupied by pixels identified as tissue.\n\n3D visualization\nTriangulated 3D surface meshes were created from the binary images for both scaffold and tissue material, using the integrated marching cubes algorithm in the BoneJ plugin (resampling factor 1 and 2 respectively) [27], [28]. The mesh models were imported into MeshLab (v.1.3.2), an open source tool developed with the support of the 3D-CoForm project, to render 3D models comprising tissue material and scaffold. A non-shrinking Taubin filter was applied to smooth the objects [29]. Surfaces were flat-shaded to enhance the faceting effect.\n\nMethylene Blue staining\nTo localize cells in the 3D scaffold prior to imaging with MRI, samples were washed gently with PBS, fixated in 10% formalin for 30 minutes and subsequently stained for 60 seconds using a 1% methylene blue solution in 0.1 M borax buffer (pH = 8.5, Sigma). Scaffolds were subsequently washed with demineralized (DI) water until the water was clear. The scaffolds were imaged with a Nikon SMZ800 Stereomicroscope equipped with a QImaging Retiga 1300 camera.\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nCell morphology and attachment was characterized by SEM analysis with a Philips XL 30 ESEM-FEG. Samples were fixated for 30 minutes in 10% formalin. Subsequently the samples were dehydrated in sequential ethanol series and critical point dried from liquid carbon dioxide using a Balzers CPD 030 Critical Point Dryer. The constructs were gold sputter coated (Cressington) prior to SEM analysis.\n\nHistological analysis\nAfter MRI measurements, samples were dehydrated using a sequential ethanol series (60, 70, 80, 90, 96 and 100% ethanol, 30 minutes for each step), and subsequently embedded in glycol methacrylate (GMA). The obtained blocks were sectioned at 5 µm intervals, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, Sigma) for visualization of the nuclei and cytoplasm.\n\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative results are presented as mean ± standard deviation and compared using one-way ANOVA (multiple conditions) with a Bonferroni post-test. Statistical significance was set to p- value <0.05 (*); <0.01 (**) and <0.001 (***).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053120/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053120/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015953/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000454/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127449/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176838/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176838/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176838/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115000/conclusions","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090018","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is elevated in allergen-provoked asthma. The cellular and molecular source of the elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide is, however, uncertain. Objective: To investigate whether fractional exhaled nitric oxide is associated with increased airway epithelial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in allergen-provoked asthma. Methods: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide was measured in healthy controls (n = 14) and allergic asthmatics (n = 12), before and after bronchial provocation to birch pollen out of season. Bronchoscopy was performed before and 24 hours after allergen provocation. Bronchial biopsies and brush biopsies were processed for nitric oxide synthase activity staining with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d), iNOS immunostaining, or gene expression analysis of iNOS by real-time PCR. NADPH-d and iNOS staining were quantified using automated morphometric analysis. Results: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and expression of iNOS mRNA were significantly higher in un-provoked asthmatics, compared to healthy controls. Allergic asthmatics exhibited a significant elevation of fractional exhaled nitric oxide after allergen provocation, as well as an accumulation of airway eosinophils. Moreover, nitric oxide synthase activity and expression of iNOS was significantly increased in the bronchial epithelium of asthmatics following allergen provocation. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide correlated with eosinophils and iNOS expression. Conclusion: Higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration among asthmatics is associated with elevated iNOS mRNA in the bronchial epithelium. Furthermore, our data demonstrates for the first time increased expression and activity of iNOS in the bronchial epithelium after allergen provocation, and thus provide a mechanistic explanation for elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide in allergen-provoked asthma.

All healthy volunteers had a negative reaction (≤0.35 kU/l) to a mix of common inhalant allergens (Phadiatop, Immuno CAP System, Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and all asthmatic subjects were asymptomatic, and used inhaled β2-agonists as needed only. A four week wash-out period for inhaled corticosteroids and a two week wash-out period for anti-histamines, anti-leukotrienes and NSAIDs was applied. None of the patients had experienced an exacerbation or respiratory infection during four weeks prior to sampling. A detailed description of the clinical parameters has been previously published [12]. Participation was voluntary and all subjects provided informed written consent. The protocol and information was approved by the local ethics committee (The Ethical Review Board in Stockholm).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090018.t001Table 1\nClinical characteristics of asthmatics and healthy controls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsthmatics\nHealthy controls\n\n\nSubjects, n\n12\n14\n\n\nSex (F/M)\n5/7\n8/6\n\n\nAge (mean, range), years\n29 (22–42)\n29 (22–46)\n\n\nFEV1% (mean ± SD)\n100±12\n105±9\n\n\nPhadiatop (% positive)\n100\nAll negative\n\n\nRAST, birch pollen (mean, SD) kU/L\n30±29\n0\n\n\nMetacholine challenge PD20 (mean ± SD)\n430±558\n0\n\n\nAllergen challenge SQ PD20 (mean ± SD)\n861±917\nND\n\n\nMaximal drop in FEV 1% after allergen challenge (mean ± SD)\n31±12\nND\n\n\n\nF, female; M, male; FEV1%, forced expiratory volume in one-second – percent of predicted normal; SQ, arbitrary units relating to the concentration of allergen; PD20, provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1; SD, standard deviation; ND, not done; RAST, radioallergosorbent test.\nLung function tests, measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and fiberoptic bronchoscopy\nExpiratory volumes were measured with a dynamic spirometer (Vitalograph®, Buckingham, UK) in a standardised manner. Both forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were determined. FENO was measured before, 1 hour after, and 24 hours after bronchial provocation, according to a previously described protocol [13]. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed as described elsewhere [14]. All subjects included in the study underwent a medical examination at least 2 weeks prior to bronchoscopy, including chest-radiographs and blood test. Following a minimum of 3 weeks after the first bronchoscopy, asthmatics were subjected to bronchoprovocation with individually adapted birch pollen extract doses (Aquagen SQ, ALK, Copenhagen, Denmark) as previously described [15], [16]. Provocation was performed outside pollen season. Bronchoprovocation was ended when a drop in FEV1≥20% from the post-diluent baseline was observed, as described elsewhere [16]. The second bronchoscopy was performed 24 hours post-allergen provocation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed as described in detail by others [13].\n\nSample preparation\nTotal and differential cell counts were prepared as previously described [17]. Snap frozen bronchial biopsies collected during bronchoscopy were embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek, Miles Laboratories, IN) and 10 µm cryo sections were generated. RNA was prepared from cells obtained by bronchial brushing using RNeasy Mini (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RNA-to-cDNA high capacity kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), was used to transcribe RNA to cDNA. The integrity of RNA was assessed on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent Technology Inc., Santa Clara, CA) using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent). Degraded samples were excluded from the analysis.\n\nHistological and immunohistochemical staining\nCryo sections where intact airway epithelium could be identified (n = 9) were air dried for 20 minutes at room temperature, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Biopsies without identified airway epithelium were excluded from the analysis. NADPH-d staining was performed as described elsewhere [18]. Sections for iNOS immunostaining were rinsed in wash buffer (K8007, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Antigen retrieval was performed in a Dako pre-treatment module at 97°C for 20 minutes with antigen retrieval buffer, pH 6.1 (EnVision™ FLEX Target Retrieval Solution, K8005, Dako). Immunostaining for iNOS was performed using EnVision™ Peroxidase/DAB Detection System kit (Rabbit/Mouse K5007, Dako) with an automated slide stainer (Autostainer Plus, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, followed by a blocking step in Dako Protein Block Serum Free solution (X0909) for an additional 10 minutes. Tissue sections were incubated with a primary rabbit polyclonal antibody NO-53 (1∶7000, kind gift from John L. Humes, Merck, USA) directed against a human 6-amino acid C-terminal iNOS peptide for 1 h, followed by incubation with a rabbit polymer/HRP-linked secondary antibody for 30 minutes. 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was applied for 10 minutes to detect immunoreactivity. Tissue sections were subsequently counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with Pertex (HistoLab, Gothenburg, Sweden). The specificity of the immunostaining was confirmed by lack of staining after omitting the primary antibody. Staining for NADPH-d or iNOS was performed simultaneously on all sections to avoid variability in staining intensity.\n\nHistological analysis and quantification\nHigh-resolution digital images of tissue specimens were generated from all sections utilizing a ScanScope Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). Morphometric analyses were performed using Aperio ImageScope v.10.0 software (Aperio Technologies). On each section, intact airway epithelium was manually delineated, and a pixel threshold for positivity was set to only include positive stained pixels (corresponding to iNOS immunoreactivity or NADPH-d staining) using Aperio Positive Pixel Count Algorithm v.9 (Aperio Technologies). For NADPH-d stained slides, the intensity threshold was set to include only strong positive cells (exclude background signal). Samples where intact airway epithelium could not be identified were excluded. Epithelial cells detached from the basal membrane were omitted from the analysis. The percentage of airway epithelium occupied by iNOS or NADPH-d staining was calculated by an investigator blinded to the protocol, using the number of immunopositive pixels above the selected threshold, and the total number of pixels (i.e. immunopositive and negative).\n\nReal-time PCR analysis\nGene expression analysis of NOS2 and NOS3 was performed in duplicates on a 7900HT thermo cycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Expression levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). All primers and probes were purchased from Cybergene (Stockholm, Sweden).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). Mann-Whitney U-test was used for pair-wise comparisons between asthmatics and controls and Wilcoxon matched pairs test when assessing effects of allergen provocation. Spearman's rank correlation test was used for correlation analyses.

In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58.6 mg a.i./L imidacloprid)+Domark (512.5 mg a.i. /L tetraconazole), Advise+Transform (58.5 mg a.i./L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a.i./L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20%, 15%, and 26% respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mg a.i./L L-cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees. Our findings indicated mixtures of Advise with detoxification-enzyme-inducing pesticides may help bees to detoxify Advise, while toxicity synergists may pose further risk to bees, such as the Bracket which not only suppressed esterase and AChE activities, but also increased toxicity to bees.\n"],"title":"Synergistic toxicity and physiological impact of imidacloprid alone and binary mixtures with seven representative pesticides on honey bee (Apis mellifera)","materials_and_methods":["\n2.1. Honey bee colony\nHoney bee (Italian) queens and colonies were originally purchased from bee keepers located in pine forest and pasture area in Magee and Perkinston, Mississippi and maintained in a managed bee yard at the Mississippi Wildlife Management Area near Stoneville, MS. An oil trap (35x45 cm tray filled with vegetable oil) was installed at the bottom of each colony for Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) and small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) monitoring and control. Deep frames with more than 50% coverage of healthy sealed brood were pulled out and transferred to laboratory incubators (33°C±0.5°C; 65%±3 RH; no light). Twenty-five newly emerged workers were transferred daily into plastic cages (see descriptions below) and were provided a piece of global paddies (1 cm3, Betterbee, Greenwich, NY) placed at the bottom of the cage and one scintillation vial of 50% sugar solution and one scintillation vial of d-H2O at the top of the cage. Caged bees were maintained in incubators at the same conditions described above until being used for experiment.\n\n2.2. Pesticides and test concentrations\nFormulated imidacloprid Advise® 2FL (Advise) and other insecticides were purchased from local agricultural chemical stores and kept in a refrigerator (6±1°C). Solutions of individual and mixture of pesticides, prepared by diluting chemical in d-H2O to a concentration equal to corresponding LC20 concentration for each pesticide, were used for spray treatments of Advise alone and mixtures with seven representative pesticides based on data of Zhu et al. [30]. These concentrations are: Advise at 274 mg/L; Bracket (acephate) at 91 mg/L; Karate (lambda-cyhalothrin) at 273 mg/L; Vydate (oxamyl) at 162 mg/L; Domark (tetraconazole) at 2500 mg/L; Roundup (glyphosate) at 2500 mg/L; Transform (sulfoxaflor) at 117 mg/L; Belay (clothianidin) at 40 mg/L.

Bioassay methods\nTo simulate field foliar spray exposure, acute toxicities of Advise (imidacloprid) alone and binary mixtures with 7 representative pesticides were previously assayed using modified spray tower [30] for synergistic toxicity and specific enzyme inhibition tests. Briefly, the spray tower was constructed with Plexiglas® to fit into a fume hood. The spray tower incorporated the original spray nozzle of Potter Spray Tower (Burkard Scientific Ltd, Uxbridge, UK) and nearly the same pressure air delivering and regulating systems as those in the Potter Spray Tower. Twenty-five newly emerged workers were transferred into a cage (made with a 500-ml round wide-mouth polypropylene jar [DxH: 9.3x10 cm]). An 8.9 cm diameter (d) hole was cut in the lid and covered with 3×3 mm-mesh metal screen for pesticide solution to spray through. Caged bees were supplied with 20 ml sugar syrupy (50%) and 20 ml d-H2O in separate scintillation vials and kept at 33°C for 8 days before being used for experiments. Three replicates (cages) were used for each treatment. Caged bees were sprayed once with 0.5 ml pesticide solution with air pressure at 69 kPa (10 psi) and spray distance of 22 cm. Sugar and water vials were removed during spraying and were placed back on the top of the cages after spraying. Sprayed (caged) bees were sent back to incubators (33°C) after spray treatments. Mortality was recorded 48-h after treatment. Three surviving bees were collected 48-h after treatment from each cage and were used for enzyme activity assays (below).\nFor specific enzyme inhibition test, caged bees were sprayed with 0.5 ml of PBO (piperonyl butoxide), TPP (triphenyl phosphate), or DEM (diethyl maleate) solution at 1% (in 50% acetone) one hour before spraying the Advise solution at 233 mg/L. Five replicates (cages) were included in each treatment.\n\n2.4. Enzyme activity assays\n\n2.4.1. Chemicals\nThe following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO): protease inhibitor (cocktail tablets), α-naphthyl acetate, fast blue B salt, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), L-glutathione reduced (GSH), 4-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), Dopamine hydrochloride, acetylthiocholine iodide (ATC), 5,5`-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), ρ-hydroxybenzhydrazide (PAHBAH), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin), 7-ethoxycoumarin (7-EC), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione reductase, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced β-NADPH).\n\n\n2.4.2. Protein preparation\nAfter 48 h of exposure to a single spray treatment, heads plus thoraxes of three surviving workers per replicate (3 replicates per treatment) from the treatment assay were ground in phosphate buffer pH7.2 with protease inhibitor and 0.3% triton X-100. The homogenization was centrifuged at 4°C, 20,800 × g, for 15min and the supernatant were collected for enzyme activity assays described below. Total protein concentration of each enzyme extraction sample was measured by Bradford protein assay kit [34] (ThermoScientific. Waltham, MA).\n\n\n2.4.3. Esterase activity assay\nEsterase activity against α-naphthyl acetate was measured using the assay method of Zhu and Gao [35]. The homogenate was diluted by 5 fold with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH7.5. The reaction solution consisted of 15 μl diluted enzyme and 135 μl 0.3 M α-naphthyl acetate. The reaction solution was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl fast Blue-SDS. Absorbance was recorded at 600 nm using a Synergy HTX plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc. Winooski, VT). The esterase activity was calculated based on a standard linear relationship established using α-naphthol.\n\n\n2.4.4. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity assay\nGST activities were determined using the protocols of Yu [36] with some modifications. The reaction solutions (200 μl) contained 10 mM GSH, 2 mM CDNB, and 10 μl enzyme extraction. The optical density (OD) was continuously measured at 340 nm every 15 sec for a total of 10 min on Synergy HTX plate reader. The specific GST activity was calculated to nmol CDNB conjugation/min/mg protein using experimentally derived “extinction coefficients” of 5.3 mM-1cm-1 [37].\n\n\n2.4.5. Invertase activity assay\nInvertase activity was determined using sucrose as substrate according to Lever [38] with some modification [39]. The reaction mixture of 100 μl enzyme extract and 900 μl 1% sucrose in 0.1 M pH4.5 acetate buffer were incubated at 55°C for 20 min in water bath. The reaction was stopped by mixing 50 μl reaction mixture with 1.45 ml 1% PAHBAH in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution and heated the mixture at 95°C for 5 min. The absorbance was measured at 410 nm. The activity of invertase was determined by hydrolyzing 1.0 μmole of sucrose to glucose and fructose per minute per mg protein at 55°C, pH 4.5.\n\n\n2.4.6. Phenoloxidase activity assay\nThe reaction solution contained 20 μl enzyme solution and 2 mM dopamine hydrochloride in pH 6.5 phosphate buffer. Phenoloxidase activity was measured at 490 nm for 30 min with 30-sec reading interval [40]. The activity of phenoloxidase was defined as the amount of enzyme which causes a change of OD 490 per minute per mg of protein in the reaction (units/min/mg protein).\n\n\n2.4.7. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay\nAChE activity was measured using acetylthiocholine (ATC) according to the method of Ellman et al. [41] with some modifications. Each reaction mixture included 50 μl enzyme extract, 0.25 mM ATC, and 0.4 mM DTNB in 150 μl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH7.5. The enzyme activity expressed by Vmax mOD/min was determined kinetically at 405 nm using Synergy HTX plate reader. AChE activities were expressed as nmol ATC hydrolyzed per min per mg protein using the extinction coefficient of 1.36×104 M−1 cm−1.\n\n\n2.5. Data processing and statistical analysis\nSAS (version 9.2) [42] was used for analysis of variance (ANOVA). Proc GLM (general linear model) procedure was applied with option of Fisher’s LSD (least significant difference) method for mean separation at P = 0.05.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176837/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152135","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nHibernation is a strategy used by some mammals to survive a cold winter. Small hibernating mammals, such as squirrels and hamsters, use species- and tissue-specific antioxidant defenses to cope with oxidative insults during hibernation. Little is known about antioxidant responses and their regulatory mechanisms in hibernating bats. We found that the total level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the brain of each of the two distantly related hibernating bats M. ricketti and R. ferrumequinum at arousal was lower than that at torpid or active state. We also found that the levels of malondialdehyde (product of lipid peroxidation) of the two hibernating species of bats were significantly lower than those of non-hibernating bats R. leschenaultia and C. sphinx. This observation suggests that bats maintain a basal level of ROS/RNS that does no harm to the brain during hibernation. Results of Western blotting showed that hibernating bats expressed higher amounts of antioxidant proteins than non-hibernating bats and that M. ricketti bats upregulated the expression of some enzymes to overcome oxidative stresses, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and catalase. In contrast, R. ferrumequinum bats maintained a relatively high level of superoxide dismutase 2, glutathione reductase, and thioredoxin-2 throughout the three different states of hibernation cycles. The levels of glutathione (GSH) were higher in M. ricketti bats than in R. ferrumequinum bats and were significantly elevated in R. ferrumequinum bats after torpor. These data suggest that M. ricketti bats use mainly antioxidant enzymes and R. ferrumequinum bats rely on both enzymes and low molecular weight antioxidants (e.g., glutathione) to avoid oxidative stresses during arousal. Furthermore, Nrf2 and FOXOs play major roles in the regulation of antioxidant defenses in the brains of bats during hibernation. Our study revealed strategies used by bats against oxidative insults during hibernation.\n"],"title":"Antioxidant Defenses in the Brains of Bats during Hibernation","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nThe field studies in this research did not involve endangered or protected species. All animal experiments were strictly followed the Guidelines and Regulations for the Administration of Laboratory Animals (Decree No. 2, the State Science and Technology Commission of the People's Republic of China, November 14, 1998) and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of East China Normal University (approval number AR2012/03001).\n\nAnimal and tissue acquisition\nHibernating bats M. ricketti (n = 12) and R. ferrumequinum (n = 12) were captured from Fangshan Cave (39°48'N, 115°42'E) in Beijing and Fish Cave (30°20'N, 117°50'E), in Anhui Province, China, respectively. Four torpid bats from each species were sacrificed on site upon capture, and four bats from each species were spontaneously aroused upon capture and sacrificed 2 hours after arousal. The remaining bats were scarified 24 hours after arousal from torpor in our laboratory where the room temperature was 27°C. Active bats (24 hours after arousal) had higher rectal temperatures and fasting blood glucose levels than bats at torpor or 2 hours after arousal (S2 Table). They also quickly responded to human disturbance. Non-hibernating bats R. leschenaultia (n = 4) and C. sphinx (n = 4) were sacrificed immediately after they were captured from Jinlun Cave of Mashan County (23°55'N, 108°26'E) in Guangxi Province and Haikou Park (20°02'N, 110°20'E) in Hainan Province, China, respectively. No water and food were given to these bats during fasting. The whole brain of each bat was rapidly removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus, n = 4) and Kunming mice (Mus musculus, n = 4), maintained in a 12-hour dark-light cycle at 26°C, were obtained from Sino-Britsh Sippr/BK Lab Animal Ltd (Shanghai, China) and sacrificed upon arrival in our laboratory. The whole brains were transferred to -80°C until used.\nAll animals including bats, rats, and mice used in this study were adult males. They were sacrificed by cervical dislocation to minimize pain and suffering. Their rectal temperatures, body weights, and fasting blood glucose concentrations are listed in S2 Table.\n\nQuantification of ROS and RNS\nThe OxiSelect™ In Vitro ROS/RNS Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA) containing a specific ROS/RNS probe, dichlorodihydrofluorescein DiOxyQ (DCFH-DiOxyQ), was used to measure the total amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (referred to as ROS/RNS hereafter), including hydrogen peroxide, peroxyl radical, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite anion. In this assay, the probe was oxidized by ROS/RNS to generate a fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the mashed brain tissue (50 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml PBS (137 mM, NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2 mM KH2PO4, and 10 mM Na2HPO4) at 4°C with a Precellys® 24 homogenizer (Bertin technologies, France). After the homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 xg, 4°C for 5 min, the clarified supernatant was collected and diluted 10 fold. An aliquot (50 μl) of the diluted supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of the catalyst reagent of the assay kit for 5 min and then with 100 μl of DCFH-DiOxyQ solution in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of DCF thus generated was measured with a SynergyTM HT spectrophotometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT) at excitation/emission wavelengths 480/530 nm. The concentration of ROS/RNS was determined fluorometrically against the DCF standards.\n\nTBARS Assay for Lipid peroxidation\nSince lipid peroxidation forms malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), the levels of MDA or 4-HNE are a measure of oxidative damage. MDA readily reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to generate the MDA-TBA adduct (one type of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), which can be quantified colorimetrically. The levels of MDA in brain tissue samples were measured by the lipid peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Briefly, the clarified supernatant derived from 100 μl of a brain homogenate was mixed with the assay reagent (200 μl) containing TBA and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT); the latter reduces the artefactual formation of lipid peroxides. The mixture was heated at 100°C for 15 min. After cooling, the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 532 nm. MDA concentration in a sample was determined by comparing its OD532 value against those of the MDA standards.\n\nImmunoblotting\nThe mashed brain tissue (100 mg) was homogenized in 2 ml lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 3.12 mM EDTA, 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) with a Precellys® 24 grinder (Bertin technologies, France). After centrifugation at 12,000 xg, 4°C for 15 min, the supernatant was collected, heated at 100°C for 10 min, and then stored at -80°C until used. Protein concentration of each sample was determined as previously described [49]. Equal amount of proteins of various samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto 0.2 μm PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). Each protein-bearing membrane was incubated in blocking solution (5% skim milk and 1% BSA) at 4°C for 12h before the primary antibody was applied. Primary antibodies against SOD1, SOD2, GSR, GPX1, CAT, NQO1, DJ-1 (PARK7), TRX2, PRDX1, PRDX3, Nrf2, Nrf2 (phospho S40), KEAP1, FOXO1 (FKHR), and FOXO3A are listed in S3 Table. These antibodies were chosen for their capability to react with conserved epitopes of the protein across diverse species. The antigen-antibody reactions on blots were visualized using the Immobilon™ Western Chemiluminescence HRP substrate kit (Millipore, USA). Images were captured with ImageQuant™LAS-4000 (Amersham Biosciences, USA). The target bands were quantified by ImageQuant™TL software (version 7.0, Amersham Biosciences, USA). Ponceau S stained blots were used to evaluate sample loading [50]. The intensity of each band on an immunoblot was normalized to that of the corresponding Ponceau S stained band.\n\nDetermination of GSSG/GSH ratio\nThe levels of total glutathione including disulfide (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) forms were determined by the colorimetric GSSG/GSH assay kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). In this assay, GSSG is reduced by glutathione reductase in the presence of NADPH to become GSH; both the preexisting and converted GSH molecules then reduce 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzonic acid (DNTB) to 2-nitriobenzonic acid (TNB), which is measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Briefly, a mashed brain tissue (50 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml PBS, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 xg, 4°C for 5 min. The supernatant obtained was diluted 8 fold with metaphosphoric acid. After an incubation at 4°C for 10 min, the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 xg, 4°C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant (10 μl) was incubated with 200 μl of the assay reagent containing glutathione reductase and NADPH for 5 min at 25°C, and the amounts of TNB thus formed were determined by measuring OD412. For determination of GSSG levels, the supernatant of the sample was pre-treated with 2-vinylpyridine to mask the SH group of GSH, so that GSH could not be converted to GSSH. Therefore, only GSSG in the sample was measured. The level of GSH was determined by subtracting the amount of GSSG from that of total glutathione in the sample.\n\nIPA prediction of transcription regulation network\nAccession numbers (from UniProt or KEGG) and changes in the levels of antioxidant proteins, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and ROS/RNS are listed in S4 Table. The interaction and regulation network of these molecules were analyzed by the Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (version 23814503) according to their functions, expression levels, and interactions as previously described [51]. The significance (P value of overlap) was determined by the Fisher’s exact test. A P value < 0.001 was considered significant.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThree repeats of each experiment were conducted. Data were presented as mean ± SD and summarized as box plots showing the mean, 25/75 percentiles (box), and 10/90 percentiles (bars). A P value < 0.05 was considered significant in a group comparison by One Way Analysis of Variance (Holm-Sidak method).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003604","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nThe p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is expressed by neurons particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Cortical, hippocampal and septal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 (E16) CF1 mouse fetuses [42]. Tissue culture wells with or without coverslips were coated with 10 µg/mL poly-L-lysine in PBS. Cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum for the first 16-20 hours, and subsequently maintained in serum-free Neurobasal medium with 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen). p75NTR+/+ or −/− hippocampal neurons were derived from E15-17 mice maintained on a C57Bl/6 background and cultured under the same conditions, with the addition of 1 mM Glutamax supplement.

Aβ oligomers were prepared using three different established methods. For the first two, Aβ peptide was resuspended in 0.5 mM NaOH [43] or 0.2% NH4OH [44] at a concentration of 350 µM and stored at −70°C. For use in cell cultures, the stock solution was incubated at 37°C for 5–7 days. In the third method [45], 1.0 mg of Aβ peptide was dissolved in 250 µl hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), aliquoted in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and HFIP was removed under vacuum in a Speed Vac. Resulting peptide films were stored desiccated at −20°C. Before use, the peptide was resuspended to 5 mM in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma), brought to 80 µM in PBS and incubated at 4°C for 16–24 hours. For the production of Aβ fibrils, HFIP-prepared peptide was brought to 222 µM in 10 mM HCl.\nPeptide preparations were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). A multimode scanning probe microscope controlled by a NanoScope IIIa controller was used in conjunction with an E-series piezoelectric scanner (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). AFM probes were etched silicon micro cantilevers, model MPP-11100 (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). Samples were applied to freshly cleaved mica using a Langmuir-Schaffer horizontal transfer system, and were then rinsed with Milli-Q Ultrapure water (Millipore, Temecula, CA) [46]. Image data was acquired at a scan rate of 0.5–1 Hz. AFM analysis (Fig. S2) of Aβ preparations demonstrated that NaOH- and NH4OH-based protocols resulted in primarily oligomeric species with occasional fibrils and that HFIP-based protocols resulted in primarily oligomeric species with rare or absent fibrils. The HCl-based protocol yielded primarily fibrillar species. Oligomeric Aβ preparations were used in all studies except as indicated in Fig. 1J.\n\nQuantitation of neuronal survival\np75NTR ligands (LM11A-24 and LM11A-31), NGF or signaling inhibitors were added concomitantly with Aβ. Aβ preparations were added to 6–7 DIV cultures at a final concentration of 5 or 10 µM followed by 72 hours incubation. Following incubation with Aβ neurons were stained with Syto 13 (Molecular Probes), Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem); or TUNEL/DAPI, using the fluorescein-12-dUTP, DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega Madison, WI), and VECTASHIELD®+DAPI (Vector Labs Burlingame, CA). Stained neurons were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2) using 520 nm (TUNEL, Syto13) or 460 nm (DAPI, Hoechst) filters. Survival of neurons was determined based on morphological criteria and Syto-13 (aids in cellular visualization) as assessed by phase contrast microscopy [47]. A dead or degenerating neuron was defined as one with a vacuolated cytoplasm, shrunken soma and/or beaded or retracted neurites. Data are expressed as percent of the total number of observed neurons that were scored as surviving. Neuron death was quantified with Hoechst 33258 by counting the number of cells containing condensed or fragmented nuclei as a percent of total observed neurons, and also with the TUNEL/DAPI system, by dividing the number of nuclei exhibiting TUNEL staining by the total number of nuclei as identified by DAPI. Cell survival analyses were confirmed by blinded counts.\n\nQuantitation of neuritic dystrophy\n21–22 DIV hippocampal neuron cultures were treated with fresh Neurobasal B27 medium containing Aβ at a final concentration of 5 µM in the presence or absence of LM11A-24 or -31 for 48 hours and then fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde. Neurites were imaged by immunostaining with MAP-2 monoclonal primary followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). MAP2 positive dendrites were quantitated using the MEASURE COUNT OBJECT function of MetaMorph 5.0 (Universal Imaging Inc, West Chester, PA). Only dendrite branches longer than 10 µm were considered (processes shorter than 10 µm were considered as sprouts). Dendrites were considered dystrophic when they showed a persistent pattern of increased tortuosity (multiple abrupt turns). To more precisely quantitate the degree of neurite curvature, we modified an established method for assessment of neurite curvature [31]. In randomly selected fields, neurite courses were digitized and approximated by a series of n manually chosen connected line segments using NIH-Image (Fig. S4). Neurite analyses were confirmed in a blinded manner. Using a Sigmaplot macro, the angle of each segment was determined relative to a line connecting the endpoints of the neurite tracing (a), and, beginning at one end, successive angles were subtracted from the prior angle in the chain, and the results averaged to give the ‘mean differential curvature’ (MDC = Σ(ai+1−ai)/n). This parameter reflects the degree of curvature over the course of the neurite with an increasing value indicating increased curvature.\n\nOrganotypic hippocampal slice cultures\nOrganotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using previously described methods [48] with modification. Briefly, 350 µm thick hippocampal slices were prepared from postnatal 8-day-old (PND-8) Wistar rats using a tissue chopper and separated in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 33.3 mM glucose, 4.2 mM NaHPO4, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM HEPES, 0.3% BSA and Penicillin-Streptomycin, pH 7.3. Slices were mounted on Millicell culture inserts and transferred to 6-well culture plates. Each well contained 1 mL of tissue culture medium consisting of 50% minimum essential medium, 25% HBSS, 25% heat inactivated horse serum and supplemented with 33 mM glucose, 12.5 mM HEPES and penicillin-streptomycin. Prior to the addition of Aβ and small molecules, organotypic cultures were matured under tissue culture conditions for 11–19 days. Culture medium was changed three times per week.\nPyramidal neuron death in brain slices was quantitated by measuring propidium iodide (PI) uptake using a previously established protocol [48]. In brief, slices were treated with Aβ±LM11A-31 for 24 hours and then with 50 µM N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA) to induce maximum pyramidal neuron death in each slice. Cellular damage was assessed by fluorescent image analysis of propidium iodide uptake (PI; 2 µg/mL), indicative of significant membrane injury. Before and after treatment, slices were observed and photographed with an inverted microscope (Nikon) coupled to a CCD camera, and mean fluorescent intensity in the CA1-3 regions was determined using OpenLab 4.04 software. Baseline (i.e. pre-treatment) fluorescence was subtracted from subsequent measurements and post-treatment cellular damage was normalized to the total neuronal density (determined by NMDA-induced PI intensity).\n\nProtein preparation and Western blotting\nFor assays of AKT, calpain, cdk5 and GSK3β activity, 21–22 DIV hippocampal neurons were incubated for 4 hours in fresh neurobasal/B27 culture medium containing 5 µM oligomeric Aβ in the presence or absence of LM11A-24, -31 or NGF. Following incubation, cells were collected and washed in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 500 µM orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin and 1 µg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated for 10 seconds, centrifuged at 14,000×g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. For tau phosphorylation studies, heat-stable fractions were prepared as described previously [49]. In brief, cells were collected by scraping cells into ice-cold TBS and centrifuging at 14000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl MES/NaCl buffer (100 mM MES, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM benzamidine hydrochloride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mM PMSF) and immediately heated to 100°C for 10 min. These were then cooled on ice and centrifuged at 14000×g at 4°C for 25 min. The tau and MAP2c-enriched supernatant was retained. Phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) levels were determined as described previously [21]. Cultured 21–22 DIV hippocampal neurons were treated with 5 µM Aβ in Neurobasal medium without B27 supplement or L-glutamine for 3 hours followed by the addition of 50 µM glutamine for 15 min in order to promote CREB activation (phosphorylation). Cells were harvested in 1× modified RIPA buffer as above with the addition of 80 mM glycerophosphate, and whole-cell extracts were then prepared. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were electrophoresed through 4–20% Tris-HCl Linear Gradient Gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Western blots were processed using the ECL Chemiluminescence System (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) and bands were quantitated using densitometry.\n\nQuantitation of c-Jun activation\nE16 hippocampal neurons harvested from CF-1 mice were plated on glass coverslips as described above or on Tissue Tek chamber slides and at 6–7 DIV were treated with 5–10 µM oligomeric Aβ for 12 hours, then fixed in fresh 4% PFA and immunostained with phospho-c-Jun specific antibody and DAPI or Hoechst to label total nuclei [35]. Activation of c-Jun was quantitated by counting p-c-Jun positive nuclei as a percent of total neuronal nuclei.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nHippocampal slice preparations were performed as described [21]. Hippocampi were harvested from 3 month old male mice (C57Bl/6; The Jackson Laboratory). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 µm in thickness) were cut and maintained in an interface chamber at 29°C, and perfused with saline solution (124.0 mM NaCL, 4.4 mM KCL, 1.0 mM Na2HPO4, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, 2.0 mM CaCL2, 2.0 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM glucose) continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. fEPSPs were recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus by placement of both the stimulating and the recording electrodes in the CA1 stratum radiatum. Basal synaptic transmission (BST) was assayed by plotting of the stimulus voltage (V) against slopes of fEPSP to generate input-output relations or by plotting of the peak amplitude of the fiber volley against the slope of the fEPSP to generate input-output relations. LTP was induced using theta-burst stimulation (4 pulses at 100 Hz, with the bursts repeated at 5 Hz, and each tetanus including 3 10-burst trains separated by 15 seconds). LM11A-31 (100 nM) (dissolved in H2O) or vehicle (H2O) was added to the bath solution for 20 minutes prior to the induction of LTP in studies in which Aβ (200 nM) was added to slice preparations. Oligomeric Aβ(1-42) was prepared using HFIP [45].\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses applied ANOVA with Dunnett's correction except for the following: in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5B ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer correction was applied; and in Fig. 6 two-way ANOVA was applied.

Most of them were mainly concerned with doses greater than 0.01 Gy and were also concerned with gamma rays. On the other hand, the studies on very low dose fast neutrons (VLDFN) are rare. In this study, we have investigated the effects of VLDFN on cell membrane and protein secondary structure of rat erythrocytes. Twelve female Wistar rats were irradiated with neutrons of total dose 0.009 Gy (241Am-Be, 0.2 mGy/h) and twelve others were used as control. Blood samples were taken at the 0, 4th, 8th, and 12th days postirradiation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of rat erythrocytes were recorded. Second derivative and curve fitting were used to analysis FTIR spectra. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to classify group spectra. The second derivative and curve fitting of FTIR spectra revealed that the most significant alterations in the cell membrane and protein secondary structure upon neutron irradiation were detected after 4 days postirradiation. The increase in membrane polarity, phospholipids chain length, packing, and unsaturation were noticed from the corresponding measured FTIR area ratios. This may be due to the membrane lipid peroxidation. The observed band shift in the CH2 stretching bands toward the lower frequencies may be associated with the decrease in membrane fluidity. The curve fitting of the amide I revealed an increase in the percentage area of α-helix opposing a decrease in the β-structure protein secondary structure, which may be attributed to protein denaturation. The results provide detailed insights into the VLDFN effects on erythrocytes. VLDFN can cause an oxidative stress to the irradiated erythrocytes, which appears clearly after 4 days postirradiation.\n"],"title":"Effects of Very Low Dose Fast Neutrons on Cell Membrane And Secondary Protein Structure in Rat Erythrocytes","materials_and_methods":["\nExperimental animals\nTwenty-four female Wistar rats (weighing 220–270 g) at three months of age were used in this study. They were purchased from the Breeding Laboratory at the King Fahd Medical Research Center (KFMRC), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The animals were allowed to acclimatize for 15 days and adapted at artificial day-night rhythm of 12 h under standard vivarium conditions with a relative humidity of 70%. Animals were maintained in box cages (3 rats/cage). They were given food and water ad libitum. This study was approved by Experimental Animal Research and Ethics Committee, KFMRC, King Abdulaziz University. Animals were randomly divided into two groups, twelve were irradiated; three rats were irradiated at each time. Twelve rats were sham-irradiated as control. Each test was analyzed separately using three irradiated rats and three control rats at time intervals postirradiation (0 day, 4, 8, and 12 days postirradiation). Rats were anaesthetized under ether during blood collection then were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and spleens were dissected that will be a subject to another study.\n\nIrradiation\nVery low dose rate was applied to the posterior portions of the rats from 185 GBq (5 Ci) 241Am-Be neutron source capsule X.14 (code AMN.24) (Amersham International PLC, Buckinghamshire, England). 241Am-Be neutron source emits spectrum neutrons from 0 up to 11 MeV [18, 19] and an average energy around 4.5 MeV [8, 20, 21]. The neutron emission of the source is 1.1 × 107 n s−1 with tolerance of around 10 %. Dosimetry measurements were performed using a neutron monitor NM2 (Nuclear Enterprise, Edinburgh, UK). Neutron monitor NM2 consists mainly of thermal neutron detector surrounded by a polyethylene moderator with a boron trifluoride (BF3) detector. The rats were irradiated at a dose rate of 0.2 mGy/h with neutrons total dose 9 mGy. Gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiations emitting from the neutron source were shielded using lead that is a good shielding material for gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiations, whereas lead is a poor shielding for fast neutrons. The thickness of used lead in the shielding was 9.6 cm. Eight percentage of neutron dose was unavoidable contamination from gamma rays but this contributed only negligibly to the biological effect because of the higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the neutrons [22].\n\nIsolation of erythrocytes\nAt time intervals postirradiation (0 day, 4, 8, and 12 days postirradiation), each rat of the tested groups was anaesthetized under ether. Peripheral blood samples (3 ml) were collected through the retroorbital plexus using capillary tubes with a diameter of 1.5 mm into 4 ml anticoagulant dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) tubes. Within 1 h of collection, the samples were processed. Blood samples were applied to Histopaque 1077 gradients (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol to separate plasma, mononuclear, and erythrocytes. Here, Histopaque 1077 gradient was used to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the blood that will be a subject to another study. Blood samples with Histopaque 1077 gradients were centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature. After first centrifugation, the plasma was removed, and the mononuclear cells were separated; erythrocytes were washed three times with sodium phosphate buffered saline (SPB) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4.2H2O, 2.0 KH2PO4, and pH 7.4) [23] and the buffy coat was discarded each time. The washing centrifugations were applied at 280 x g for 12 min (4°C) [24]. Then, all samples were stored at -80°C in a deep freeze. After that, the samples were lyophilized using ALPHA 1–2 LDplus freeze dryer (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode, Germany) at −60°C and under the vacuum 66 × 10−3 mbar [11, 25].\n\nFTIR spectra\nLyophilized erythrocytes with potassium bromide (KBr) (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Poole, England) were prepared as KBr discs. For each disc, 2 mg of lyophilized erythrocytes were ground to fine powder with mortar and pestle. 198 mg of KBr was then added with further grinding and mixing. The mixture was then pressed in a die at 6 metric tons force for 60 s [11, 26] to turn out to a clear transparent disc of diameter 13 mm and thickness 0.57 mm. At room temperature, FTIR spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with germanium-coated KBr plate beam splitter and temperature controlled high sensitivity deuterated, L-alanine doped triglycine sulfate (DLATGS) detector. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry nitrogen to minimize atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide interference. Typically, 20 scans were signal-averaged for a single spectrum and at spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. The triplicate FTIR spectra were obtained from each rat. The spectra were collected with IRsolution software (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Then, they were saved as the joint committee on atomic and molecular physical data- data exchange (JCAMP-DX) format. After that, they were operated with OMNIC 8.3 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Massachusetts, USA). To minimize the difficulties arising from unavoidable shifts, the entire spectrum has been baseline corrected in the 4000–400 cm−1 region. Every spectrum has been min–max normalized by scaling the entire spectrum to the absorbance of amide I (around 1654 cm−1). Finally, the average of the triplicate FTIR spectra was obtained. Second derivative and curve fitting of erythrocytes spectra were used to obtain features that occur on spectral peaks and were used to estimate if the features are important in terms of their relationship between control and irradiated groups or in the ability to predict the repair during postirrradiation time.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were represented with their mean value ± standard deviation (SD) using ORIGIN 8.0951 software (OriginLab Corporation, Massachusetts, USA). The differences between control and irradiated data were tested using the t-test for independent measurements. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is a simple and rapid procedure that depends on the similarity between two objects [27, 28]. It was used to distinguish between spectra of control and irradiated rats. Using Ward’s algorithm Euclidean distance linkage tree, HCA was used to classify the second derivative of the FTIR spectra into two regions, (3500–2800 cm−1) that contains protein, amides A and B, and CH groups of lipid of cell membrane and (1800–1500 cm−1) that contains protein, amides I and II. HCA was performed by PAST version 2.17b software [29].\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139854/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176871","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nTerrestrial laser scanning is a powerful technology for capturing the three-dimensional structure of forests with a high level of detail and accuracy.

Moreover, 3D Forest provides quantitative measures of between-crown interactions and their real arrangement in 3D space. 3D Forest also includes an original algorithm of automatic tree segmentation and crown segmentation.

Major rivers here are composites of different ancient rivers, resulting in isolation and mixing episodes between river basins over time. This history influenced the diversification of most of the aquatic fauna. The genus Pantosteus is one of several clades centered in this tectonically active region. The eight recognized Pantosteus species are widespread and common across southwestern Canada, western USA and into northern Mexico. They are typically found in medium gradient, middle-elevation reaches of rivers over rocky substrates. This study (1) compares molecular data with morphological and paleontological data for proposed species of Pantosteus, (2) tests hypotheses of their monophyly, (3) uses these data for phylogenetic inferences of sister-group relationships, and (4) estimates timing of divergence events of identified lineages. Using 8055 base pairs from mitochondrial DNA protein coding genes, Pantosteus and Catostomus are reciprocally monophyletic, in contrast with morphological data. The only exception to a monophyletic Pantosteus is P. columbianus whose mtDNA is closely aligned with C. tahoensis because of introgression. Within Pantosteus, several species have deep genetic divergences among allopatric sister lineages, several of which are diagnosed and elevated to species, bringing the total diversity in the group to 11 species.

Nine of the 13 mtDNA protein coding genes (ND1, ND2, ND4L, ND4, ND5, ND6, ATPase6/8, cytb and partial sequence from COIII) were amplified, representing approximately half of the mitochondrial genome (8055 bp). We obtained a large proportion of the mitochondrial genome in order to be able to obtain robust phylogenetic relationships as using a small number of genes provided poor resolution [47]. We did not pursue nuclear gene sequencing due to the low resolution of nuclear genes in the same species of catostomids [48], which indicates that a large number of nuclear loci would be required to provide informative phylogenetic results. Single and nested PCR amplification strategies were used to obtain product for different gene combinations. Details of the primers and nesting combinations are in Figure S1. For nested PCR the first reaction size was 10 µL. This first PCR reaction was then diluted to 1∶49, and 1 µL of this product was added to a second 25 µL reaction. All other single reactions were 25 µL. Final concentrations for PCR components were as follows: 25 ng template DNA, 0.25 µM of each primer, 0.625 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 µL of 10X reaction buffer and 2.5 mM MgCl2. Amplification parameters were as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s (in the first nested reactions this was increased by 1 min per each thousand bp), and 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were examined on a 1% agarose gel using SYBR safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) and purified using a Montage PCR 96 plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Sequences were obtained via cycle sequencing with Big Dye 3.0 dye terminator ready reaction kits using 1/16th reaction size (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were run with an annealing temperature of 52°C (following the ABI manufacturer's protocol), cleaned using Sephadex columns in MultiScreen 96 well assay plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and then dried. Most sequences were obtained using an Applied Biosystems 3730 XL automated sequencer at the Brigham Young University DNA Sequencing Center. All sequences obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank, accession numbers KJ441082-KJ441387 and the sequence alignment was deposited in Dryad, doi:10.5061/dryad.51mm0.\n\nAnalysis of Sequence Data\nSequences were edited using Chromas Lite 2.0 (Technelysium, Tewantin, Queensland, Australia) and imported into BioEdit 7.0.5.2 [49]. Sequences coding for amino acids were aligned by eye and checked via amino acid coding in MEGA 4.0.2 [50] to test for unexpected frame shift errors or stop codons. Editing resulted in 8055 base pairs representing the complete sequence for the nine genes, plus 22 bp of COIII. Phylogenetic analyses were performed under maximum likelihood (ML) using RAxML 7.2.8 [51], [52] by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates with the final best ML tree being calculated using the GTRGAMMA model on the CIPRES cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was conducted with PAUP* 4.0b10 [53] using a heuristic search with 1000 random additions and TBR branch swapping. Tree lengths reported for MP include both informative and uninformative characters. Robustness of nodes for MP was estimated by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates using a heuristic search with 10 random additions and TBR branch swapping. The ML tree from the DNA analysis presented in this study was deposited in TreeBASE, accession number TB2:S15337, (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S15337). Average between-species genetic distances were calculated based on the proportion of shared differences (p-distance) using MEGA for each lineage within Pantosteus, Catostomus as a whole, and then the remaining outgroups as a whole.\n\nMorphology and Age Estimates\nEighty-seven morphological characters and eight fossil occurrences were taken from [20]. Calibration of the rate of evolution requires fossils to be assigned to specific branches based on synapomorphies shared by the fossils and recent taxa. This is achieved by cladistic interpretation of apomorphic characters for each fossil. These taxa are then represented as terminal taxa on specific branches. Confidence limits of estimates of times of cladistic branching have two primary sources of error: (1) fossils are unlikely to represent a lineage soon after its divergence from its sister lineage [54], and (2) both sister lineages do not necessarily possess new apomorphies of the lineages immediately after their initial genetic isolation. Fossils of both lineages should ideally contribute to estimation of age of a node, but both are rarely available in the record. For these reasons it is not obvious which end of the stem branch of a crown group should be assigned the age represented by the fossil. We choose to correct the age of the oldest fossil bearing synapomorphies of a lineage in question with the method of [54], which uses the density of the record of other fossils from that lineage to estimate the age of origin of the stem branch. The number of million-year time horizons or independent localities in which fossils of the lineage occur are applied in an equation that uses these data to estimate the probability that the oldest fossil represents the first (unobserved) appearance of the lineage [54]:where a is the confidence interval as a fraction of the total known stratigraphic range, C1 is the 50% or 95% confidence level, and H is the number of known fossil horizons. The 50% interval is chosen as the mid-point of the distribution for calculation of the node calibration points. These were entered into the BEAST analyses. The ages of the oldest fossils, their identities, apomorphies, calibration points, locations, number of horizons, stratigraphy, and catalog numbers are given below, following best practice recommendations by [55].\nAn important assumption is that the fish of interest could have lived in a depositional environment below the oldest fossil, so that the absence of fossils possessing synapomorphies of a specific lineage can be interpreted as absence of the lineage at that time. The probability that the earliest fossil occurrence represents the first occurrence following cladogenesis is then used to correct the age estimate. The corrected age is applied to the node joining the taxa bearing the morphological synapomorphies supporting their sister-group relationship (Fig. 3).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090061.g003Figure 3\nMaximum likelihood (ML) tree for Pantosteus based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA.\nA collapsed maximum parsimony (MP) topology is shown in the upper left corner, the thick branches indicate differences in topology to ML. All bootstrap values are based on 1000 pseudoreplicates, a # symbol represents bootstrap values over 95 for both ML/MP. Single bootstrap values are shown for nodes which are different to MP. The tree is rooted with Cycleptus elongatus. Locality details are provided in Table 1.\n\nBEAST 1.7.1 [56] was used to estimate molecular divergence times of mtDNA lineages based on corrected fossil age estimates. We generated input files using BEAUti 1.7.1. The dataset was trimmed to single representatives per species/lineage because having a mix of within- and between-species data complicates dating owing to different processes for estimating within- versus between-species rates [57] (S. Ho, pers. comm.). The analysis used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock with rate variation following a tree prior using the speciation birth-death process, a GTR+I+G model (identified using the AIC in Modeltest 3.7, [58]). The topology was constrained to match the ML results.\nCalibrations were based on eight time horizons [20], with age of occurrence estimated for two nodes with two date estimates in each based on [54]. These two dates, 5.5 Ma and 12.7 Ma were given a log-normal prior with a standard deviation of 1. BEAST analyses were run for 50 million generations, with parameters logged every 10000 generations. Multiple runs were conducted to check for stationarity and to ensure that independent runs were converging on a similar result. The log and tree files from four runs were combined in LogCombiner 1.7.1 with a 10% burn-in. The combined logfile was examined in Tracer 1.5, while the combined treefile was summarized using TreeAnnotator 1.7.1 with the mean values placed on the maximum clade credibility tree.\nThe diagnoses of recent and fossil forms with specimen disposition for taxa in the morphological phylogenetic analysis are detailed in [20]. Identities, localities, and curatorial data for 347 western catostomin skeletons can be accessed at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology Fish Division website. The morphological tree was estimated with PAUP, using 87 partly new osteological and morphological traits defined and listed in matrix format in [20]. Inferred instances of introgression are plotted on the tree, based on observed scatter of non-congruent morphological and molecular character states. Alternative hypotheses (such as convergence and retained polymorphisms) were examined by contrasting molecular and morphological trees. High bootstrap support values were used to identify strongly supported nodes in each analysis. Conflict between nodes on these two trees allowed rejection of alternative hypotheses.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090061/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127491","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":[""],"title":"Correction: 18F-Mefway PET Imaging of Serotonin 1A Receptors in Humans: A Comparison with 18F-FCWAY"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127491/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127491/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127491/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127491/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090061/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090061/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090061/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176870/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176870/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176870/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176870/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139853/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139853/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nLinkage maps based on markers derived from genes are essential evolutionary tools for commercial marine fish to help identify genomic regions associated with complex traits and subject to selective forces at play during exploitation or selective breeding. Additionally, they allow the use of genomic information from other related species for which more detailed information is available. Sole (solea solea L.) is a commercially important flatfish species in the North Sea, subject to overexploitation and showing evidence of fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in growth- and maturation-related traits. Sole would definitely benefit from a linkage map to better understand how evolution has shaped its genome structure. This study presents a linkage map of sole based on 423 single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from expressed sequence tags and 8 neutral microsatellite markers. The total map length is 1233.8 cM and consists of 38 linkage groups with a size varying between 0 to 92.1 cM. Being derived from expressed sequence tags allowed us to align the map with the genome of four model fish species, namely medaka (Oryzias latipes), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). This comparison revealed multiple conserved syntenic regions with all four species, and suggested that the linkage groups represent 21 putative sole chromosomes. The map was also compared to the linkage map of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), another commercially important flatfish species and closely related to sole. For all putative sole chromosomes (except one) a turbot homolog was detected, confirming the even higher degree of synteny between these two flatfish species.\n"],"title":"A Genetic Linkage Map of Sole (Solea solea): A Tool for Evolutionary and Comparative Analyses of Exploited (Flat)Fishes","materials_and_methods":["\nMapping families\nTwo full-sib families with 46 and 35 offspring respectively were used for the linkage analysis. The sampling of the parents, broodstock management, offspring collection and DNA extractions were done by Blonk [27] and were part of a large breeding program, initiated by Solea B.V. (The Netherlands) and the Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre (Wageningen University), aiming at increased productivity of farmed sole. All procedures were in accordance with the Dutch law. The parents originated from the Southern North Sea (52°N and 2.5°E) and were collected between 2003 and 2005. Details on the management of the broodstock including these parents (called ‘B’) and their offspring can be found in [28]. Of each parent a blood sample (0.1 ml) was taken without killing them (as they were part of the sole breeding program). DNA was extracted from this sample using a Puregene DNA purification kit for non-mammalian whole blood samples (Gentra Systems). DNA extraction of the offspring was performed on 3 to 4 days old larvae using nucleospin tissue columns following the manufacturer’s guideline (96 procedure, Machery-Nagel).\n\nGenetic markers and genotyping\nUsing the Roche FLX Titanium technology, in total 348,042 cDNA sequences were generated from a multiplexed sole muscle library based on seven sole individuals sampled across the East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea (unpublished data). A total of 11,021 contigs could be assembled and over 3,000 SNPs detected in silico. Among those, 1,536 SNPs were selected for validation using the Illumina GoldenGate™ high-throughput genotyping assay. Some of these markers have already been applied successfully in a traceability context [29]. The inheritance and the informativeness of the markers were visually checked with the GenomeStudio™ genotyping module of Illumina. Of the 1,536 genotyped SNPs, 749 were not informative within the two families. For 21 SNPs inconsistencies with mendelian inheritance were observed and for 297 SNPs the genotyping assay failed. An overview of the remaining 469 SNPs that were used to perform linkage analysis, can be found in S1 Table. In addition both families were genotyped at the following 10 microsatellite markers with the method described in Blonk et al. [28]: AF173849, AF173852, AF173854, AF173855 [30], AY950587, AY950588, AY950589, AY950591, AY950592, AY950593 [31]. In total 479 markers (469 SNPs and 10 microsatellites) were included in the linkage analysis. A high number of missing data often indicates either poor DNA quality or markers that are difficult to call, which may lead to difficulties in linkage map construction. Therefore, individuals or markers with more than 30% missing data were excluded from the dataset, being two individuals and none of the markers. The final dataset consisted of two families with respectively 46 and 33 offspring (with no more than 3% missing values per individual) and 479 markers (of which only 13 SNPs had more than 3% missing data).\n\nLinkage map construction and genome coverage\nSNPs located within the same contig were combined into haplotypes using the program Pedphase v3.0 [32]. The map was built with the program Cri-map v2.4 [33]. Initial grouping of the markers was carried out using the twopoint and autogroup option of Cri-map. The twopoint analysis was performed for all pairs of markers with a threshold of LOD = 3. Autogroup was then used to identify sets of markers which were likely located in the same linkage group (LOD ≥8). Some small linkage groups were pooled based on additional information: (1) an autogroup analysis with a lower threshold (LOD of four instead of eight) and (2) if linkage was found between the majority of the markers after performing an additional twopoint analysis with a threshold of LOD = 0.5. Secondly, the position of the SNPs and microsatellite markers within the groups was determined with the build option of Crimap in an iterative process, starting with a LOD score of 3 and through subsequent stepwise lowering of the LOD score. Finally, marker order was calibrated using the flips option with a window size of five markers. The map was drawn in the program Mapchart v2.2 [34]. Two methods were used to estimate the genome length (Ge) of sole. According to Fishman et al. [35] corrections should be made for chromosome ends by adding 2*Dav to the length of each linkage group, where Dav is the average inter-marker distance of the linkage map. Chakravarti et al. [36] suggested to multiply each linkage group by (m+1)/(m-1), where m is the number of loci in each linkage group (4th method in Chakravarti et al. [36]). The average length calculated by both methods was used as an estimate for the genome length (resp. Ge1 and Ge2).\n\nComparative mapping and syntenic relationships\nAs all SNPs in the sole map were discovered from ESTs, the assembled contigs were used as queries to perform a local blast against the genome of four fully sequenced fish species: medaka (Oryzias latipes, order Beloniformes), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, order Cichliformes), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, order Perciformes) and green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis, order Tetraodontiformes). Of all available model species, these four are most closely related to the Pleuronectiformes, each representing a different order within the Percomorphaceae [37]. Genomic information was downloaded from the genome browser Ucsc (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). A Blastn analysis was performed with NCBI-Blast under default settings with exception of the E-value (<10−10). To establish syntenic relationships with turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) a direct comparison by blast analysis was not possible, as this species is not fully sequenced yet. Therefore, the stepping stone approach as described by Sarropoulou et al. [38] was used. The four model species were used as a bridge which allowed passing from the sole linkage groups to those of turbot.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0115040/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040844/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000484/introduction","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000484/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000484/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000484/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065746/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065746/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152180/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0152180/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102424/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065746/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065746/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065746/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176869","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nNumerous restoration campaigns focused on re-establishing species-rich floodplain meadows of Central Europe, whose species composition is essentially controlled by regular flooding.

Recently, the fate of DCs has been found to be extremely dependent on the interaction with autologous NK cells, but the mechanisms by which NK-DC interaction controls viral infections remain unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of NK-DC cross-talk on maturation and functions of HIV-infected immature DCs. Methodology/Principal Findings: Immature DCs were derived from primary monocytes, cultured in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF. In some experiments, DCs were infected with R5-HIV-1BaL or X4-HIV-1NDK, and viral replication, proviral HIV-DNA and the frequency of infected DCs were measured. Autologous NK cells were sorted and either kept unstimulated in the presence of suboptimal concentration of IL-2, or activated by a combination of PHA and IL-2. The impact of 24 h NK-DC cross-talk on the fate of HIV-1-infected DCs was analyzed. We report that activated NK cells were required for the induction of maturation of DCs, whether uninfected or HIV-1-infected, and this process involved HMGB1. However, the cross-talk between HIV-1-infected DCs and activated NK cells was functionally defective, as demonstrated by the strong impairment of DCs to induce Th1 polarization of naïve CD4 T cells. This was associated with the defective production of IL-12 and IL-18 by infected DCs. Moreover, the crosstalk between activated NK cells and HIV-infected DCs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral DNA expression in DCs. HMGB1, produced both by NK cells and DCs, was found to play a pivotal role in this process, and inhibition of HMGB1 activity by glycyrrhizin, known to bind specifically to HMGB1, or blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies, abrogated NK-dependent HIV-1 replication in DCs. Conclusion: These observations provide evidence for the crucial role of NK-DC cross-talk in promoting viral dissemination, and challenge the question of the in vivo involvement of HMGB1 in the triggering of HIV-1 replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs in AIDS.

A written agreement was obtained for each donor to use the cells for clinical research according to French laws. Our study was approved by IRB, external (Etablissement Français du Sang Board) as required by French law and internal (Biomedical Research Committee Board, Institut Pasteur) as required by Pasteur Institute.\nWe isolated CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs by positive selection using CD14-specific immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). To generate iDCs, purified CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 5 days (1×106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml), in the presence of 10 ng/ml of recombinant human (rhu) GM-CSF and 10 ng/ml rhIL-4 (Peprotech INC, Rockyhill, USA) as described [54]. Culture medium was replaced every 2 days. NK cells were isolated by negative selection from PBMCs depleted of monocytes using a depletion cocktail of antibodies directed to CD3, CD4, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD36, CD123, CD66b, Glycophorin A (StemCell Technologies). The NK cell content of the enriched fraction, determined by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson) as CD3−CD56+ cells with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 and APC-conjugated anti-CD56 antibodies, ranged from 85 to 95% in the different experiments. Contamination with myeloid cells, evaluated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 antibodies was consistently less than 1%. Naïve CD4 T cells (CD4+CD45RA+) were isolated from PBMCs by positive selection, using CD4- and CD45RA-specific immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Cell purity of isolated naïve CD4 T cells was routinely more than 90%.\n\nActivation and infection of NK cells\nPurified NK cells were cultured at 106 cells/ml either in the presence of suboptimal concentration of IL-2 (100 ng/ml) (Peprotech) to maintain them alive (referred as rNK) or were activated by a combination of PHA (10 µg/ml) (Sigma) and IL-2 (10 µg/ml) (referred as aNK cells). In some experiments, aNK cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated during 3 h in the presence of HIV-1 (1 ng/ml p24) and further cultured for 21 h. Under those conditions, no productive infection could be observed. Culture supernatants were then tested for cytokine and chemokine detection (see below).\n\nMaturation and phenotypic analysis of DCs\nAfter 6 days of culture in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF, iDCs (106 cells/ml) were either non stimulated, or stimulated during 48 h with 10 µg/ml LPS (E. Coli serotype 026-B6, Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain DC0 cells, or 500 ng/ml of trimeric CD40L (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain DC1 cells, or 10 µg/ml of LPS and 1 µg/ml PGE2 (Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain DC2 cells. Phenotypic analysis of DCs and characterization of their maturation stage was performed by flow cytometry. DCs were stained for 20 min at 4°C with antibodies specific for CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, CD40, DC-LAMP or DC-SIGN (all antibodies from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) diluted in 100 µl of PBS/10% FCS/0.1% NaN3. In some experiments, antibodies specific for HMGB1-receptor, RAGE (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), was used to stain DCs. After two washings, cells were fixed in 1% PFA, immediately acquired on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow Jo software.\n\nInfection of DCs with HIV-1\nVirus stock preparation was prepared by amplification of R5-HIV-1BaL and X4- HIV-1NDK on MDM and PHA+ IL-2 activated PBMC from healthy donors, respectively. Viral stock was then clarified by centrifugation prior to determination of HIV-1 p24 concentration. iDCs were plated in 96-well culture plates at 200,000 cells/well and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with HIV-1 at various concentrations (0.001 to 10 ng p24/ml). Cells were harvested, washed four times with media containing 10% FCS and, when indicated, rNK or aNK cells were added at a NK∶DC ratio of 1∶5, unless otherwise indicated. NK-DC cocultures lasted 24 h before analysis of the maturation stage of DCs and/or quantification of viral production. In some experiments (Fig. 6), HIV-1 infected iDCs were incubated alone or with aNK cells for 3 days, in the presence of rh-HMGB1 (1 µg/ml) (R&DSystems), rabbit anti-HMGB1 Abs (10 µg/ml) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or Glycyrrhizin (10 µg/ml).\n\nQuantification of HIV-1 viral production, proviral load and of the frequency of infected DCs\nWe determined the concentration of HIV-1 in the supernatant of infected cell cultures by measuring the amount of p24 protein by ELISA (Ingen, Belgium). We extracted DNA from cells using the GIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) and quantified HIV-1 proviral load by RT-PCR as described previously [55]. The frequency of HIV-1-infected cells was determined by flow cytometry to detect intracellular p24 molecule. Cells were surface stained with antibodies specific for CD40 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to target DC and intracellular stained with p24-specific antibodies (Coulter). Stained cells were fixed in 1% PFA, immediately acquired on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo software. In some experiments infected DCs were imaged, after immunofluorescence, by laser scanning confocal microscopy.\n\nCocultures of iDCs with NK cells\nrNK or aNK were cocultured during 24 h with iDCs or mDCs at a ratio of 1∶5 (2×105 NK+10×105 DC/ml), unless otherwise indicated. DC survival was determined with the 7-AAD assay, as described previously [56]. Briefly, cultured cells were stained with 20 µg/mL nuclear dye 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD; St. Quentin-Fallavier, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 4°C, and co-stained with CD56-specific antibody (BD Biosciences, San jose, CA). Surviving DC were identified as CD56− 7-AAD− cells. When phenotypic characterization of DCs was performed in NK-DC cocultures, NK cells were always excluded from the FACS analysis through their staining with CD56-specific antibodies.\n\nMeasurement of cytokine and chemokine production\nCell-free culture supernatants were prepared by incubating for 24 h iDCs at 106 cells/ml, rNK or aNK cells at 2.105 cells/ml or aNK and iDC cells at the ration of 1∶5. Chemokines and cytokines were measured by Luminex (24 plex kits; Biosource) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 50 µl of supernatant or standard was incubated with antibody-linked beads for 2 h, washed twice with wash solution, and incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibodies. A final incubation of 30 min with streptavidin-PE preceded the acquisition on the Luminex 100IS. At least 100 events were acquired for each analyte. Values above or below the standard curves were replaced by the lowest or the highest concentrations measured. Quantification of HMGB1in cell free culture supernatants was performed with an ELISA kit (IBL, Hamburg). In experiments testing Th1 polarization of naïve CD4 T cells by NK-triggered DCs (Figure 4), quantification of IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-18 in culture supernatants was performed with ELISA kits (IL-12 and IFN-γ kits from R&D Systems, IL-18 kit from MBL).\n\nTh1 polarization assay\nNaïve CD4 T cells (106/ml) were cocultured for 8 days in the presence of uninfected or HIV-1-infected iDC (106/ml) and resting or activated NK cells (2×105/ml) and tested for Th1 polarization by flow cytometry, as previously reported [57]. Briefly, brefeldine A (10 µg/ml) (Sigma Aldrich) was added during the last 16 h of the culture to inhibit protein secretion. Surface staining was performed with PerCP-conjugated CD8 antibodies and FITC-conjugated CD3 antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), followed by cell fixation for 15 minutes at 4°C with 1% PFA and permeabilization with saponin buffer (PBS-BSA 0.2%-NaN3 0.01%- saponin 0.5%), and intracellular staining was performed with APC-conjugated IFNγ ̃- or IL-4- specific antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Stained cells were immediately acquired on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow Jo software. In order to analyze the influence of HIV-1 replication on Th1 polarization, AZT 1 mM was added at the initiation of the culture of naïve CD4 T cells incubated alone, or in the presence of HIV-1-infected iDCs+/−rNK or aNK cells. AZT was left until the end of the coculture. HIV-1-infection of iDCs was performed as described above, in the absence of AZT.\n\nStastitical analyses\nStatistical analyses were made with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The P value of significant differences is reported. Plotted data represent mean±standard deviation (s.d.).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003601/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077947","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Although cervical cancer is ​​the second most common tumor among Brazilian women, studies that evaluate the quality of life of these women are still scarce. This situation is explained by the lack of specific and validated tools for this purpose in Portuguese (Brazil). The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the FACT-CX (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix) questionnaire in a population of Brazilian women with cervical cancer. Methods: The psychometric properties of the FACT-CX questionnaire were tested in a sample of 100 women diagnosed with cervical cancer who were previously treated in the Barretos Cancer Hospital. We analyzed the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient - ICC), confirmatory factor analysis, convergent validity (correlation with the SF-36 questionnaire), and discriminant validity by disease stage and two questions related to self-perception of health was also performed. Results: The scales had Cronbach´s alpha coefficients ranging from 0.61 to 0.80. However, three scales did not have a statistically significant coefficient greater than 0.70. The ICC ranged from 0.68 to 0.82 and all considered satisfactory. Factor analysis did not generate consistent components.  The FACT-G and FACT-CX total scores had good internal consistency and reproducibility, and also correlated well with the General Health and Vitality scales of the SF-36. However, only two FACT-CX scales had a significant correlation with SF-36.  Discriminant analysis showed that FACT-CX failed to discriminate groups according to clinical stage but was able to divide the women according to the self-perception of health. Conclusion: FATC-CX total score had good internal consistency, reproducibility and discriminant validity. In addition, it correlated well with General Health and Vitality scales of SF-36. However, three scales had questionable internal consistency and only two had significant correlation with SF-36.

Here, we investigated the effects of acute (3-day) T4 supplementation on energy expenditure at rest and during incremental exercise. Furthermore, we used a combination of in situ and in vitro approaches to measure skeletal muscle metabolism before and after T4 treatment. Ten healthy, euthyroid males were given 200 µg T4 (levothyroxine) per day for 3 days. Energy expenditure was measured at rest and during exercise by indirect calorimetry, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function was assessed by in situ ATP flux (31P MRS) and in vitro respiratory control ratio (RCR, state 3/state 4 rate of oxygen uptake using a Clark-type electrode) before and after acute T4 treatment. Thyroxine had a subtle effect on resting metabolic rate, increasing it by 4% (p = 0.059) without a change in resting ATP demand (i.e., ATP flux) of the vastus lateralis. Exercise efficiency did not change with T4 treatment. The maximal capacity to produce ATP (state 3 respiration) and the coupled state of the mitochondria (RCR) were reduced by approximately 30% with T4 (p = 0.057 and p = 0.04, respectively). Together, the results suggest that T4, although less metabolically active than T3, reduces skeletal muscle efficiency and modestly increases resting metabolism even after short-term supplementation. Our findings may be clinically relevant given the expanding application of T4 to treat non-thyroidal conditions such as obesity and weight loss.\n      "],"title":"Effect of Short-Term Thyroxine Administration on Energy Metabolism and Mitochondrial Efficiency in Humans","materials_and_methods":["\n        Subjects\n        Ten healthy normal- to mildly over-weight (BMI 20–27 kg/m2) male Caucasian subjects were enrolled in this study. We chose to study only young non-obese males to reduce biological variability due to sex, age and obese status. All subjects were non-smoking and not taking any medications affecting body weight or metabolism. Prior to participation, subjects underwent a screening visit where they had their height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) measured, answered questions about their health history, and underwent a standard physical exam and blood draw for measurement of chemistry panel, lipid profile and thyroid function (T3 and TSH).\n      \n        Ethics Statement\n        All subjects gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center.\n      \n        Study Design\n        Participants received a total of 600 µg of T4 over the course of the study, given in 100 µg doses administered approximately every 12 hours. The daily T4 dose was chosen to be in the upper range of usual treatment doses, which varies from 75 to 250 µg/day [9]. The average dose per kg body weight was 2.7±0.2 µg/day. The experimental protocol and timing of testing procedures is outlined in Figure 3. Subjects were admitted to the Inpatient Unit of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center the evening before baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (day 4) testing. After completing baseline testing on day 1, subjects were given their first T4 dose (levothyroxine sodium 100 µg tablet, Sandoz, Princeton, NJ) followed by lunch and were then free to leave the Center. On Days 2 and 3 participants were given 100 µg T4 prior to consuming breakfast and dinner at the Center; lunch was packed to go. Subjects were re-admitted to the Inpatient Unit the evening of day 3. On the morning of day 4, subjects consumed their last thyroxine dose prior to repeating baseline testing. Caloric requirements to maintain energy balance throughout the 4-day study were determined using previously published equations [25]. All meals were prepared by the Metabolic Kitchen and consisted of 55% CHO, 35% fat, and 15% protein.\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0040837.g003\n          Figure 3\n          \n            Experimental protocol and timeline of testing procedures.\n          \n          \n        \n      \n        Body Composition\n        Body composition was measured one time during the study, on day 2, by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologics, QDA 4500A; Bedford, MA). Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were calculated from weight and whole-body percent fat.\n      \n        Day 1 and Day 4 Testing Procedures\n        \n          Resting metabolic rate\n          Following a 10-h overnight fast, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was determined by measuring O2 consumption and CO2 production using a metabolic cart (Deltratrac II, Sensormedics; Yorba Linda, CA). The cart was calibrated before each test with room air and standard calibration gases (4% CO2 and 96% O2). The first 10 minutes of data were discarded and the last 20 minutes were used to calculate RMR. Resting respiratory quotient (RQ), an index of the mix of energy substrate oxidation, was calculated as the ratio of CO2 produced/O2 consumed. Blood was drawn after the RMR test on days 1 and 4 for measurement of thyroid hormones.\n        \n        \n          Skeletal muscle ATP turnover\n          Following the RMR measure, ATP turnover (ATPflux) of the vastus lateralis was measured by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy as previously described [26], [27]. Briefly, spectra were acquired during a 5-min baseline rest period and for 16 min while a blood pressure cuff was inflated above the site of interest to 60 mm Hg above systolic pressure. The breakdown of phosphocreatine under anoxic conditions represents mitochondrial ATP demand, i.e., cellular ATP use minus glycolytic ATP supply [28], [29]. Spectra were analyzed using the Advanced Method for Accurate, Robust and Efficient Spectral fitting (AMARES) algorithm in the jMRUI software [30]. Using this method, repeated measures of muscle ATPflux on the same subject (n = 4) agree to within ±5.0%.\n        \n        \n          Mitochondrial coupling\n          Muscle biopsy was performed at the site of the MRS spectra acquisition using the Bergstrom technique [31]. Immediately following tissue collection, approximately 100–150 mg of whole muscle was minced in 1 ml ice-cold mitochondrial extraction buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM Tris-Base, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, pH 7.5, ice cold) and subjected to a protease digestion (Type XXIV, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 7 minutes [32]. Protease digestion was terminated immediately by adding 1 ml of extraction buffer. The tissue was homogenized and centrifuged at 700 g and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 14,000 g to collect a mitochondria pellet. The final pellet was resuspended in Mannitol-Sucrose Solution (220 mM Mannitol, 70 mM Sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, ice cold). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225, Rockford, IL).\n          Oxygen consumption was measured in isolated mitochondria at 37°C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, England). The electrode was surrounded by a temperature-controlled water-jacketed glass chamber to maintain the temperature at 37°C. Mitochondria were suspended at a concentration of 80 µg/400 µl in Wander’s Respiration Buffer and the measurement was carried out in a medium containing 100 mM KCl, 50 mM MOPSO, 10 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM glucose, 5 mM glutamate, 0.2%BSA and pH 7.0. Mitochondrial respiration was initiated by adding the substrates sodium pyruvate (1.25 mM) and malate (1.25 mM). After reaching a stable rate, coupled respiration was initiated by adding ADP (0.375 mM). After determination of the maximal ADP-initiated respiration, oligomycin (1.6 µg/ml) was added to block complex V (ATP synthase) and provide a measure of non-ADP coupled respiration (i.e. leak-induced). Rates of oxygen consumption were expressed as nmol O2/ml/min. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) was defined as the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption (State 3) divided by the rate of leak-induced respiration (State 4). FCCP (3 µM) was added to stop state 4 respiration and induce maximal mitochondrial respiration.\n        \n        \n          Mitochondrial content\n          Mitochondrial (mt) content was determined as the average of the ratio of ND1 and ND4 (mitochondrial-encoded) to 18S (nuclear-encoded) genes. Briefly, DNA was extracted from the vastus lateralis biopsy tissue using the Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer’s protocol. mtDNA was determined using qPCR methods measured on a 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using Assays on Demand (ND1: Hs02596873_s1; ND4: Hs02596876_g1; 18S: Hs99999901_s1). qPCR expression was quantified using a standard curve of known DNA concentrations.\n        \n        \n          Uncoupling protein 3 expression\n          RNA from vastus lateralis tissue that had been snap- frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen was extracted using the miRNEasy mini kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was made using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was measured on a 7900 Sequence Detection System using Assays on Demand (UCP3: Hs01106052_m1; RPLP0: 99999902_m1). Expression of UCP3 was quantified using a standard curve of known cDNA loading concentration and normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene Ribosomal Protein, Large Protein 0 (RPLP0).\n        \n        \n          Exercise efficiency\n          A week prior to the exercise efficiency test, participants were familiarized with the protocol and equipment to reduce the test-retest variability. Non-resting metabolic efficiency was determined by measuring energy expenditure (EE) during an incremental exercise test on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer [33] (Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands). Briefly, after a 10-min warm-up period at 0 Watts (W, no resistance), subjects cycled for 6 min at 0 W to measure respiratory gas exchange during ‘unloaded’ exercise. Then, participants underwent an incremental exercise test for 6 min per stage at 35 W, 70 W, 105 W and 140 W while maintaining a constant pedal rate of 60 RPM. Stages were separated by 6 min of rest. CO2 and O2 were measured during the entire test (TruOne 2400, ParvoMedics, Inc. Sandy, Utah) with the average of the last 2 min of each stage (steady state) used to determine energy expenditure and substrate utilization. Exercise efficiency was expressed in several ways for this study: gross, work, and delta efficiency. Gross efficiency was defined as the workload divided by energy expenditure. Work efficiency was calculated as the workload divided by the estimated load-free (y-intercept) subtracted energy expenditure at a given workload. The relative cost of performing incrementally increasing work (delta efficiency) was calculated as the inverse of the slope (derivative of dE/dW) for energy expenditure (E) and work rate (W) across workloads. Fitness level was not used as an exclusion criterion and we expect that our participants were of varied fitness levels. As such, we anticipated that energy expenditure at the higher workloads in the lesser fit participants may be influenced by anaerobic metabolism. To account for this, the caloric equivalents for oxygen were clamped to those of an RER  = 1.00 suggestive of 100% carbohydrate oxidation.\n        \n      \n        Statistical Analysis\n        Data are expressed as mean ± SD or mean (range) and the level of significance for all statistical tests was set at p<0.05. Analyses were performed using JMP version 7.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Differences in body weight, thyroid hormones, heart rate, blood pressure, and mitochondrial bioenergetics before and after thyroxine treatment were analyzed using paired t-tests. Differences in RMR, resting RQ, and delta efficiency before and after T4 were determined by one- and two-way repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc analysis using Student’s t test. All data were found to be normally distributed; therefore Pearson correlations were performed on variables of interest. Associations between the change in free T4 level (day 4 - day 1) and the change in RMR, delta efficiency, tissue ATP flux, and mitochondrial coupling were analyzed by multiple linear regression controlling for baseline (day 1) free T4.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040837/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102412","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 (EcO157) associated with the 2006 spinach outbreak appears to have persisted as the organism was isolated, three months after the outbreak, from environmental samples in the produce production areas of the central coast of California. Survival in harsh environments may be linked to the inherent fitness characteristics of EcO157. This study evaluated the comparative fitness of outbreak-related clinical and environmental strains to resist protozoan predation and survive in soil from a spinach field in the general vicinity of isolation of strains genetically indistinguishable from the 2006 outbreak strains. Environmental strains from soil and feral pig feces survived longer (11 to 35 days for 90% decreases, D-value) with Vorticella microstoma and Colpoda aspera, isolated previously from dairy wastewater; these D-values correlated (P<0.05) negatively with protozoan growth. Similarly, strains from cow feces, feral pig feces, and bagged spinach survived significantly longer in soil compared to clinical isolates indistinguishable by 11-loci multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis. The curli-positive (C+) phenotype, a fitness trait linked with attachment in ruminant and human gut, decreased after exposure to protozoa, and in soils only C− cells remained after 7 days. The C+ phenotype correlated negatively with D-values of EcO157 exposed to soil (rs = −0.683; P = 0.036), Vorticella (rs = −0.465; P = 0.05) or Colpoda (rs = −0.750; P = 0.0001). In contrast, protozoan growth correlated positively with C+ phenotype (Vorticella, rs = 0.730, P = 0.0004; Colpoda, rs = 0.625, P = 0.006) suggesting a preference for consumption of C+ cells, although they grew on C− strains also. We speculate that the C− phenotype is a selective trait for survival and possibly transport of the pathogen in soil and water environments.\n"],"title":"Strain Differences in Fitness of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to Resist Protozoan Predation and Survival in Soil","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics statement\nSoil samples were provided by the Western Center for Food Safety and Security, University of California at Davis. No special permits were required as the soils were collected under cooperative agreements with produce growers and the samplings did not involve any endangered or protected species.\n\nStrains of EcO157 used in this study\nEcO157 strains (Table 1) were selected based on sample source and genetic similarities determined by multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and reported in a previous study [28]. Clinical and environmental strains of four different MLVA types (Table S1) associated with the 2006 spinach outbreak were used in these comparisons. All but one of the strains was highly related by 11-loci MLVA; strain RM9834 differed from the others at 9 loci. All of them carry virulence genes, stx2 (Shiga-toxin), eae (intimin), and hly (hemolysin); and serotype specific genes, fliC (H7-antigen) and rfbE (O157-antigen) [28]–[30]. Purity of cultures was confirmed by plating on Rainbow agar (Biolog, Hayward, CA) containing novobiocin (20 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and tellurite (0.8 µg/ml, Invitrogen/Dynal) (Rainbow-NT).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102412.t001Table 1\nEcO157 strains associated with 2006 spinach outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nStrain No.\nMLVA type\nSource\nState\nDetailsa\n\n\n\n\nRM6441\n176\nCow feces\nCA\nCDPH-FDLB, Paicines ranch\n\n\nRM6103\n163\nCow feces\nCA\nCDPH-MDL, Paicines ranch\n\n\nRM6088\n176\nCow feces\nCA\nCDPH-MDL, Paicines ranch\n\n\nRM6096\n163\nCow feces\nCA\nCDPH-MDL, Paicines ranch\n\n\nRM6440\n176\nCow feces\nCA\nCDPH-FDLB, Paicines ranch\n\n\nRM6157\n176\nFeral pig feces\nCA\nPaicines ranch\n\n\nRM6106\n174\nFeral pig feces\nCA\nPaicines ranch\n\n\nRM6155c\n163\nFeral pig feces\nCA\nPaicines ranch\n\n\nRM9834c\n778\nSoil\nCA\nCSREES Environmental Study, Ranch Jb\n\n\nRM9993\n163\nSpinach bag\nPA\nCDC\n\n\nRM6067c\n163\nSpinach bag\nPA\nPennsylvania Department of Health\n\n\nRM6068\n163\nSpinach bag\nPA\nPennsylvania Department of Health\n\n\nRM9996\n163\nSpinach bag\nPA\nCDC\n\n\nRM6331c\n163\nClinical\nOR\nOregon State Public Health Lab\n\n\nRM6653c\n163\nClinical\nWI\nCDC\n\n\nRM6069c\n163\nClinical\nPA\nPennsylvania Department of Health\n\n\nRM6654c\n163\nClinical\nNM\nCDC\n\n\nRM6657c\n163\nClinical\nUT\nCDC\n\n\n\naCDPH-FDLB, California Department of Public Health – Food and Drug Laboratory Branch; CDPH-MDL, California Department of Public Health – Microbial Diseases Laboratory; CSREES, USDA Cooperative state Research, Education, and Extension Service; and CDC, Centers for Disease Control.bIsolated repeatedly from pasture soil during a 45-day period during 2009. All other strains were isolated during the outbreak period.cStrains used in the soil fitness study.\nPreparation of inoculums and enumeration of EcO57\nIsolated colonies from Rainbow-NT agar were grown over-night in 10% Luria broth (LB, Fisher Scientific, PA) at 25°C and at 150 rpm on a gyratory shaker, cells were separated by centrifuging at 10,000×g for 5 min and washed twice in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.0) and adjusted to OD600 of 0.3 prior to inoculations to Sonneborn medium (Solution 1 of ATCC medium 802, http://www.atcc.org/Attachments/4018.pdf) or soil. Enumeration of EcO157 from soils or protozoa media was carried out by plating 100 µl volumes of 10-fold serial dilutions in 0.01 M PBS onto Rainbow-NT agar and the bluish-grey colonies were counted after over-night incubation at 37°C. Some colonies were tested at random by real-time PCR to confirm the presence of O157-antigen specific gene rfbE, using a method described previously [28].\n\nEnumeration of phenotypic variant subpopulations\nThe proportion of phenotypic variants of EcO157 strains, post-protozoan or soil exposure, expressing C was determined as described previously [27], with some modifications. Briefly, twenty isolated colonies from each of three replicates, confirmed as EcO157 on Rainbow-NT agar plates initially, were patched on LB agar without NaCl, but supplemented with 40 µg/ml of Congo red dye and 10 µg/ml of Coomassie brilliant blue G (Congo red agar). Thus, a total of 60 colonies for each strain of EcO157 were analyzed for determining the proportion of C variants. C+ (red) and C− (white) colonies were tested at random to confirm the presence of rfbE [28]. The proportion of C subpopulations prior to soil or protozoan exposure were determined by plating serial dilutions of over-night growth from LB agar onto Congo red agar.\n\nConsumption of EcO157 strains by protozoa\nConsumption of EcO157 strains was determined using V. microstoma and C. aspera isolated previously [14] from dairy wastewater. Twenty-five milliliters of sterilized 10% Sonneborn medium in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.0) supplemented with 5% 3-µm filtered and heat-killed wastewater was inoculated with 1×108 CFU/ml of EcO157 and 2×103 cells of protozoa per ml (50,000 bacteria/protozoa). A 7-day old growth of protozoa in Sonneborn medium was used as inoculum. Overnight growth of EcO157 strains in 10% LB broth, centrifuged and resuspended in 0.01 M PBS was used as the bacterial food source for protozoa. The populations of both EcO157 and protozoa during a 7-day incubation without agitation at 25°C were determined using methods described previously [14] except that 5-fold serial dilutions in 0.01 M PBS were used for counting protozoa by the MPN method. The comparisons were in triplicate and days for 90% decreases (D-value) of EcO157 as a result of consumption by protozoa were calculated. Stationary incubations aid in grazing of EcO157 by micro-vortexing and filter feeding by the ciliates. Two-way ANOVA coupled with Bonferroni post t-test (Prism 4.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) or Holm-Sidak pairwise multiple comparisons (Sigmaplot v11, Systat software, Inc., Chicago, IL) were used to compare differences in growth of protozoa and differential uptake of EcO157 by protozoa. Changes in C subpopulations as influenced by protozoa also were statistically analyzed.\n\nSurvival of EcO157 in soil from a produce field\nSurvival of nine EcO157 strains (Table 1) was monitored in the <45 µm fraction of fine soil (US standard sieve, 325 mesh, Hogentogler, Columbia, MD) collected from a produce field from lower Salinas Valley in Monterey County, CA (Farm R). Soil samples from this field were cultured by methods described previously for the presence of EcO157 [28]. One gram samples of soil in 4-ml screw capped glass vials (Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ) were inoculated with ∼1×107 CFU of EcO157 cells in 160 µl and adjusted to moisture at 50% water holding capacity (26.1% moisture on dry weight basis) by adding 110 µl sterile distilled water. Vials containing the inoculated soils were capped loosely to allow aeration, incubated at 25°C and sampled at regular intervals for the enumeration of surviving EcO157 cells and for analyzing the proportion of C subpopulations as described above. The moisture loss at each sampling interval was monitored by weighing another set of vials containing un-inoculated soil. Soils were mixed thoroughly with sterile spatulas and ∼100 mg soil samples by weight were removed and used to make 10-fold serial dilutions for enumeration of EcO157. D-values were calculated based on the decreases in EcO157 populations during a 7-day incubation period. All the comparisons were in triplicates and the data was analyzed statistically as described above. In addition, Spearman rank order correlations were used to compare the fitness of EcO157 in soil with resistance to predation; growth increases of protozoa and the proportion of C subpopulations.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102412/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077933","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Bidirectional relationship between migraine and depression suggests that there might be some etiological risk factors shared. However, few studies investigated resting state abnormalities affected by depressive symptoms in migraine patients without aura (MWoA). Materials and Methods: According to their self-rating depression scale (SDS) score, MWoA were divided into twenty in the SDS (+) (SDS > 49) group and 20 in the SDS (−) (SDS ≤ 49) group. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) method were employed to assess local features of spontaneous brain activity between 1) all MWoA and healthy controls, 2) each subgroup and healthy controls, and 3) SDS (−) group and SDS (+) group. Results: Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo in similar regions were shown in the MWoA group and subgroups. It is noteworthy that the caudate showed increased ReHo in the SDS (−) group compared with healthy controls and the SDS (+) group. Moreover, the average ReHo values of the caudate in SDS (−) group were significantly positively correlated with duration of migraine. Conclusions: Our results suggested that ReHo patterns in migraine patients may be affected by depressive symptoms and serve as a biomarker to reflect depression severity in MWoA.

MWoA were screened following the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society [16]. Age- and gender-matched healthy controls that had no family members who either suffered from any type of headache or depression disorder were enrolled. The exclusion criteria for both groups were: 1) any physical illness such as a brain tumor, hepatitis, diabetes or epilepsy as assessed according to clinical evaluations and medical records; 2) any psychiatric disease; 3) alcohol, nicotine or drug abuse; 4) pregnancy or menstrual period in women; 5) not being right-handed as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ; 6) organic brain defects on T1 or T2 images (examined by two experienced radiologist); 7) claustrophobia and 8) any anti-depressant treatment.\n\t\t\t\tAt last, forty MWoA (11 males and 29 females, aged 22–57 years, mean age, 35.9±10.3 years) and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (10 males and 30 females, aged 21–54 years, mean age, 33.2±9.5 years) were recruited in our study. All participants signed the informed consent after the experimental procedure was fully explained. Prior to scanning, urine drug screening was performed on all subjects to exclude the possibility of substance abuse. Attack frequency in the past 4 weeks and duration of migraine attacks was also rated. All of patients were not either having a migraine precipitated during or on the day following the scan or a migraine attack at least 72 hours prior to scanning [17]. In addition, depression symptoms of all participants was evaluated by the SDS test [15]. The SDS consists of 20 items presented in a 4-point multiple-choice format with a scale of 1 to 4. The scores ranged from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating increased level of depressive symptoms. The four possible outcomes were as follows: 20–49 normal range, 50–59 mildly depressed, 60–69 moderately depressed, 70 and above severely depressed [18]. According to the SDS scores, the MWoA were divided into two groups including the SDS (−) group (7 males and 13 females, aged 22–57 years, with a mean age: 33.6±11.7 years, SDS score under 49 with a mean score: 39.1±5.0) and the rest were assigned to the SDS (+) group (4 males and 16 females, aged 22–55 years, with a mean age: 38.2±8.4 years, SDS score 60.3±6.6). The mean SDS score in healthy controls was 37.6±4.0. Average pain intensity was rated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) on a 0-10 scale from attacks in the past 4 weeks, which was 4.8±1.4 in the SDS (−) group and 5.5±1.9 in the SDS (+) group.

Siemens Medical System) at the Huaxi MR Research Center, West China Hospital at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. The heads of the subjects were positioned carefully with comfortable support to reduce head motion. Prior to the functional run, T1 and T2 weighted images for each subject were acquired to exclude the possibility of clinically silent lesions and were examined by two expert radiologists. The resting state functional images were obtained with an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (30 contiguous slices with slice thickness = 5 mm, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 240×240 mm2, data matrix = 64 ×64, and total volumes = 180). Subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed, not to think about anything, and to stay awake during the entire 6 minute functional scan. After the scan, each subject was asked whether s/he remained awake during the whole procedure. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tData analysis\n\t\t\t\tAfter an inspection of the quality of raw functional images, all of the data preprocessing procedures were performed in SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), including slice timing, realignment, and normalization. The first five volumes were discarded to ensure stable magnetization and allow participants to adapt to the scanning environment. The images were corrected for the acquisition delay between slices, aligned to the first image of each session for motion correction, and spatially normalized to the standard MNI template in SPM5. No subjects had head motion exceeding 1 mm of movement or 1° of rotation in any direction. A band-pass filter (0.01 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz) was applied to remove physiological and high frequency noise. To reduce the effects of head motion and non-neuronal BOLD (heart rate and respiration changes), nine nuisance signals (the global mean, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signals and 6 motion parameters) were regressed out as nuisance covariates.\n\t\t\t\tBy using the Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST, by SONG Xiao-Wei et al., http://www.restfmri.net), Kendall’s coefficient concordance (KCC) was used to evaluate regional homogeneity [4]. A whole brain mask was used to remove non-brain tissues. Individual ReHo maps were generated by assigning each voxel a value corresponding to the KCC of its time series with its nearest 26 neighboring voxels [4].The individual ReHo maps were standardized by their own mean KCC within the mask . Then, a Gaussian kernel of 4 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was used to smooth the images for the aim to reduce noise and residual differences [19]. \n\t\t\t\tStatistical analysis of functional images was performed in SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). For the whole MWoA group and healthy controls, a one-sample t-test (p < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) correction) was performed to extract the ReHo results across the subjects within each group. Then, a two-sample t-test was applied to compare the ReHo results 1) between all healthy controls and all MWoA, 2) between each subgroup (the SDS (−) group and SDS (+) group) and controls, and 3) between the SDS (−) group and SDS (+) group to examine differences in ReHo (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Finally, to further investigate the association between the ReHo abnormality and the duration in MWoA, Pearson’s correlation analyses were carried out. The average ReHo values in the regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted, averaged and correlated with the duration of MWoA. Distributions of age, gender, duration, attack frequency, VAS and SDS scores among groups and correlation analysis were analyzed using SPSS statistical analysis software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) and MATLAB (2010b, Natick, Massachusetts; The Mathworks Inc.).\n\t\t\t"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0077933/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090052/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090052/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090052/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090052/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090052/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0176858","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["Background: Direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus have shown dramatic results in clinical trials. However, their effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated within observational cohorts which lack exclusion criteria found in randomized control trials. Aim: To determine the effectiveness of dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in achieving sustained virological response. Methods: Retrospective observational cohort study of all Clalit Health Services members with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 who were dispensed dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir from January 1, 2015 to-November 31, 2015. Results: There were 564 participants during the study period. The average age was 61.9 years, 52.0% were male, and 61.5% were born Eastern/Central Europe or Central Asia. The prevalence of diabetes was 31.7% and 70.3% were overweight/obese. Cirrhosis was present in 41.0% of participants, of whom 52.8% had stage 4 fibrosis. Of the cohort, 416 (74.8%) had follow-up viral load testing at 10 or more weeks after the end of treatment. We report a sustained virological response of 98.8% among those tested. Conclusions: Treatment with dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir demonstrated a near universal effectiveness in achieving a sustained virological response among HCV patients in a large cohort. "],"title":"Effectiveness of dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for hepatitis C virus in clinical practice: A population-based observational study","materials_and_methods":["\nDesign overview\nThis was a retrospective observational cohort study comprised of members enrolled in CHS, Israel’s largest integrated payer-provider system, who were dispensed at least one prescription of the 3D protocol after January 1, 2015, and prior to November 30, 2015 (allowing for sufficient follow-up as of the date of data extraction on February 21, 2016).\nThe study was approved by CHS’s institutional review board.\n\nSetting\nHealthcare in Israel is mandatory and universal. All citizens and residents can freely choose membership in any of the four integrated payer-provider healthcare systems, which are required by law to offer the same basic list of services, including prescription medications on the National List of Reimbursed Drugs. CHS’s membership is comprised of over half of the Israeli population (more than 4.3 million people) and the switching rate between providers is low (less than 2% annually) [18].\nIn Israel, the 3D protocol was the first new DAA protocol to be included in the National List of Reimbursed Drugs and became available in January 2015 for all people infected with HCV (genotype 1a or 1b) who had concurrent advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or 4). CHS introduced an additional recommendation for participants to undergo a viral load test in the first month following treatment initiation to assess treatment responsiveness.\n\nData sources\nCHS's fully integrated electronic health records database was accessed for this study. These records include members’ demographic characteristics and clinical co-variates (outpatient and inpatient), laboratory values, medication prescription and purchasing information, as well as clinical markers such as body mass index (BMI) and patient-reported data. The data are linked according to each member’s unique national identification number which is used anonymously in research studies.\n\nCase definition\nAll CHS members who were dispensed at least one prescription for the 3D protocol during the study period were included in the study. This study had no further inclusion or exclusion criteria.\n\nExposure\nParticipants who were prescribed the 3D protocol received a single tablet of dasabuvir 250 mg to be taken twice daily, and two tablets containing a combination of ombitasvir 12.5 mg, paritaprevir 75 mg, and ritonavir 50 mg to be taken once daily. Genotype 1b with compensated cirrhosis and genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis also received ribavirin. The suggested treatment duration was a 24-week course for participants with HCV genotype 1a and compensated cirrhosis, and all others were to receive a 12-week course. However, there was allowance for clinical judgment in choosing which treatment duration to prescribe.\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcome of this study was a sustained virological response (SVR) or a non-detectable viral load (<15 IU/mL) at 10 or more weeks after the end of treatment. The 10-week duration was chosen due to the potential variation in local community clinic practices and laboratory processing, as cited previously in similar effectiveness studies [11, 13, 17]. Three additional viral load test results are provided for comparison: the baseline viral load test in IU/mL prior to initiation of treatment (<15, ≥15 to <800,000, ≥800,000 to <2 million, ≥2 million to <6 million, ≥6 million, and positive, non-quantifiable), an early response assessed at 4 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) following the initiation of treatment, and a viral load at the end of treatment (+/- 2 weeks), as determined by the date of the first purchase and the duration of the approved regimen. These latter values are provided categorically in IU/mL (≥15 to <1,000, ≥1,000 to <1 million, ≥1 million).\nThe 3D protocol was only dispensed as a complete 4-week supply. Ribavirin, when prescribed, could be dispensed in any number. Adherence is calculated as the proportion of days covered. Adherence of 80% or more to the treatment regimen was considered adherent.\n\nDemographic characteristics and co-morbidities\nDemographic characteristics on members included age, sex, region of birth [19], and socioeconomic status (as defined by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics). Clinical co-variates considered in the study included: diabetes (identified using an algorithm previously-validated within the Clalit system [20]), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (staging based on estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] calculated using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration [EPI]: stage 1, stage 2, stage 3a, stage 3b, stage 4, stage 5, renal replacement therapy (any documentation of end stage renal disease, kidney failure, dialysis, or renal transplant), Charlson morbidity score [21], morbidity burden based on the resource utilization bands of the Adjusted Clinical Groups® (ACG) system [22] (containing 5 groups of resource utilization; 1 represents the lowest burden and 5 represents the highest burden), BMI category (kg/m2: underweight ≤18.5, normal weight 18.5 to ≤25, overweight 25 to ≤30, and obese 30 or more), and smoking status (current, former, and non-smoker).\nHepatitis-specific markers included alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferance (AST), platelets, AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) score, presence of cirrhosis according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes (any, compensated [cirrhosis or esophageal varices], decompensated [encephalopathy, esophageal varies and bleeding, portal syndrome, jaundice, or ascites]), stage of fibrosis (as determined by transient elastography, biomarkers, or liver biopsy), diagnosis of liver transplant, co-infection with laboratory-confirmed HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (positive HBsAg), and years from first confirmed HCV diagnosis (earliest among laboratory tests for antibody, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], genotype, or viral load) were also included. Any prior treatment regimen was recorded (specifically, of at least one purchase of the following regimens: peginterferon and ribavirain; peginterferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir; peginterferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir; or peginterferon).\n\nStatistical analysis\nBasic demographic characteristics and clinical co-variates of the participants in the study population were compared to those of the general CHS population who were in the same age range as the participants (21 to 90 years old, unadjusted). These characteristics were extracted on the date of treatment initiation for participants and on January 1, 2015 for the general CHS population. Participants were categorized by genotype sub-groups (1a, 1b, or unknown) due the known association with country of birth and the potential socioeconomic differences between those groups and the treatment duration (12-weeks or 24-weeks). Baseline hepatitis-specific markers, co-morbidities, and primary and secondary outcomes were also compared among the participants of the study. Finally, demographic characteristics, clinical co-variates, and hepatitis-specific markers were compared between participants who were and were not assessed for SVR to examine whether there were any significant differences between groups that could suggest a bias in the outcomes. Categorical comparisons were conducted using Fisher exact test for nominal comparisons and Cochran-Armitage for ordinal comparisons. Bivariate continuous variables were compared using Student t-test for normal distributions and Mann-Whitney for non-parametric tests. The statistical software used was SPSS version 22.0 (IBM, Chicago IL).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065734/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065734/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nThe mature mammalian organ of Corti does not regenerate spontaneously after injury, mainly due to the absence of cell proliferation and the depletion of otic progenitors with age. The polycomb gene B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1) promotes proliferation and cell cycle progression in several stem cell populations. The cell cycle inhibitor p16ink4a has been previously identified as a downstream target of Bmi1. In this study, we show that Bmi1 is expressed in the developing inner ear. In the organ of Corti, Bmi1 expression is temporally regulated during embryonic and postnatal development. In contrast, p16ink4a expression is not detectable during the same period. Bmi1-deficient mice were used to investigate the role of Bmi1 in cochlear development and otosphere generation. In the absence of Bmi1, the postnatal organ of Corti displayed normal morphology at least until the end of the first postnatal week, suggesting that Bmi1 is not required for the embryonic or early postnatal development of the organ of Corti. However, Bmi1 loss resulted in the reduced sphere-forming capacity of the organ of Corti, accompanied by the decreased cell proliferation of otic progenitors in otosphere cultures. This reduced proliferative capacity was associated with the upregulation of p16ink4a in vitro. Viral vector-mediated overexpression of p16ink4a in wildtype otosphere cultures significantly reduced the number of generated otospheres in vitro. The findings strongly suggest a role for Bmi1 as a promoter of cell proliferation in otic progenitor cells, potentially through the repression of p16ink4a.\n"],"title":"Bmi1 Loss in the Organ of Corti Results in p16ink4a Upregulation and Reduced Cell Proliferation of Otic Progenitors In Vitro","materials_and_methods":["\nAnimals and genotyping\nAnimal experiments were approved by the Tübingen Regional Council (Regierungspräsidium) (animal experiment approval HN4/14 and approval of animal use for organ explantation dated June 27, 2012 and July 27, 2015). All animals received care in compliance with the Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\nAll of the animals were housed in an in-house animal facility at the University of Tübingen. C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) (Jax stock number 005304). Bmi1-GFP mice [23] (Jax stock number 017351) were provided by Irving Weissman (Stanford University). Genotyping of the Bmi1-GFP mice was performed using genomic DNA samples. Genomic DNA isolation was performed using the DirectPCR-EAR reagent (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping primers were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). Separate PCR protocols were performed for the wildtype and mutant alleles. The following primer sequences were used: 1) Common: GAGAATCCAGCTGTCCAGTGT; 2) Mutant Rev: GACACGCTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTA; and 3) Wildtype Rev: TACCCTCCACACAGGACACA.\nPCRs were performed using PuReTaq Ready-To-Go™ PCR Beads (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nTissue harvest and fixation\nTo determine the Bmi1 expression pattern in the mouse cochlea, mice were sacrificed at the following time points: 1) embryonic day (E)13.5: the approximate time of the terminal mitosis of OC progenitors in mice [5]; 2) postnatal day (p)0: when the OC undergoes differentiation but is immature; and 3) p28: when the OC is functionally mature (n≥4 animals for all time points). Timed breedings were initiated, and the females were inspected the next morning for the presence of a vaginal plug; this day was then regarded as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Individual embryo whole heads were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 2 hours at 4°C. For early postnatal mice, half-heads were fixed in 2% PFA for 2 hours at 4°C. Mice aged p14 and older were anesthetized with CO2 before being euthanized. For the fixation of the cochlea, the entire inner ear was excised from the temporal bone and fixed by perfusing the perilymphatic fluid spaces with 4% PFA through open round and oval windows using a 30-gauge needle syringe (Microlance®, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The cochleae were then incubated in 4% PFA for 2 hours at 4°C.\n\nDecalcification, cryoembedding and cryosectioning\nFor mice aged p7 and older, the fixed cochleae were decalcified in 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 24 hours at 4°C. For cryoprotection, the heads or the isolated cochleae were incubated in 5%, 10%, 15%, and then 20% sucrose (Merck-Millipore) in 1x PBS for 1 hour per dilution. The specimens were kept at 4°C overnight in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS. The following day, the heads or the isolated cochleae were transferred into a cylindrical vessel made of aluminum foil, which was then filled with Tissue-Tek® OCT™ Compound (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) and stored at -80°C. Cryosections were prepared at a 12-μm thickness using a cryostat (Leica CM3050, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were placed on SuperFrost® Plus microscope slides (Langenbrinck, Emmendingen, Germany), left to dry for 60 minutes at room temperature and then stored at -80°C.\n\nImmunolabeling and microscopy\nThe Bmi1 expression pattern was investigated by Bmi1 immunohistochemistry and using the Bmi1-GFP reporter mouse line, in which exon 2 of the native Bmi1 sequence has been replaced with GFP, resulting in a null allele [23]. For Bmi1 immunohistochemistry, Bmi1WT/WT (Wildtype, WT) sections were labeled with a monoclonal anti-Bmi1 antibody, with retinal sections used as a positive control (data not shown), as previously described [26]. For the Bmi1-GFP reporter mouse line, Bmi1GFP/WT (Heterozygous, Het) sections were labeled with an anti-GFP antibody, with duodenum sections used as a positive control (data not shown), as previously described [27]. Bmi1GFP/GFP animals do not show Bmi1 expression [23] and were regarded as Bmi1 knockouts (KO) and used as a negative control for immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating slides in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 minutes using a steam cooker (only for Bmi1 immunohistochemistry). The slides were allowed to cool for 5 minutes, were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1x PBS and were subsequently incubated with 5% normal donkey serum (NDS, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× PBS for 30 minutes to block non-specific binding. When a mouse primary antibody was used, an additional blocking step was performed with the Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.™) Blocking Reagent (MKB-2213, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature to block fluorescence caused by native mouse IgG. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Counter-staining was performed using the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI, Molecular Probes–Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Finally, slides were mounted with glass cover slips (R. Langenbrinck) using FluorSave™ mounting medium (Calbiochem–Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and were stored in the dark at 4°C until microscopic analysis. A list of primary and secondary antibodies is provided in S1 Table. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Axio Imager M2 with an ApoTome.2 unit (Zeiss AG, Göttingen, Germany).\n\nRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)\nBmi1 and p16ink4a mRNA levels in the OC were quantified in cochlear sensory epithelium specimens of C57Bl/6 mice at seven developmental time points: E13.5, p0, p4, p7, p14, p21 and p28. At each developmental stage, 2 independent samples were analyzed (each sample contained 4 pooled OC specimens). For the analysis of individual OC specimens of different genotypes, WT, Het and KO OC samples were harvested at p0, and analyzed independently (each sample contained two pooled OC specimens from a single mouse). For the OC-derived spheres, WT, Het and KO OC samples were cultured using the otosphere assay for 5 days in vitro (DIV) (see below), after which the generated spheres were harvested and analyzed independently (each sample contained 2000–3000 spheres obtained from two ears of a single mouse). After tissue micro-dissection, the samples were immediately placed into the lysis buffer of the RNAqueous®-Micro Kit (AM1931) (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). RNA isolation was performed using the same kit. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed using a Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (05081955001, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transcript levels were measured with the Quant-iT™ assay on a Qubit™ Quantitation Platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). mRNA levels were measured using qRT-PCR. For each qRT-PCR reaction, the cDNA level was adjusted to 5 ng in a total volume of 20 μl, and the reaction was performed using a LightCycler® 480 Probes Master Mix (04707494001, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Hprt, Tbp, Ubc and Gapdh were used as housekeeping genes. Bmi1, Hprt, Tbp, Ubc, Gapdh, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 probes were designed by RealTime Ready Single Assays (Roche Applied Science) with the following Assay IDs: Bmi1 (311828), Hprt (307879), Tbp (300314), Ubc (311816), Gapdh (307884), Caspase-3 (300362) and Caspase-9 (300366). For detecting p16ink4a mRNA, a FAM-conjugated TaqMan probe was purchased from TIB Molbiol GmbH (Berlin, Germany) and was used in combination with the following primers: p16-Forward, GGTCGTACCCCGATTCAGGT and p16-Reverse, TCGAATCTGCACCGTAGTTGAG. The CT values were determined using LightCycler® 480 Software version 1.5.0 SP4 (Roche Diagnostics), and the relative quantification was calculated using the formula 2-ΔΔCT [28]. Measurements were conducted in triplicate for each sample.\n\nOtosphere assay\nThe OCs of p0 Bmi1WT/WT (WT), Bmi1GFP/WT (Het) and Bmi1GFP/GFP (KO) littermates were micro-dissected and cultured, as previously described [4, 20]. Two OCs from each animal were grouped together and considered as one specimen. Briefly, the OC specimens were incubated with 0.25% trypsin / EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes at 37°C. Enzymatic digestion by trypsin was stopped by the addition of a trypsin inhibitor (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA), and the cells were mechanically dissociated by trituration. Cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber and were seeded into 10 ml Petri dishes (Greiner Bio-one GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) containing medium supplemented with growth factors, as previously described [20]. The culture medium was composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/ F12 media (mixed 1:1), with N2 and B-27 supplements (Gibco®, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ampicillin (100 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), in addition to the growth factors bFGF (10 ng/mL, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and IGF-1 (50 ng/mL, R&D Systems). After 5 days in vitro (5DIV), the spheres were visually counted under an inverted microscope with a 20x objective (Zeiss AG). After sphere counting, 10 μM 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the culture medium for an additional 24 hours. EdU is a synthetic thymidine analogue that is incorporated during DNA synthesis in proliferating cells and, thus, is used as a marker for the S-phase of the cell cycle. At 6DIV, the sphere suspension was transferred to 8-well slides (BD Biosciences) that were pre-coated with 10% Matrigel® (Growth Factor Reduced, BD Biosciences). The spheres were then fixed with 2% PFA for 15 minutes at 4°C. Immunolabeling was performed for Ki67, which marks all active phases of the cell cycle [29], and phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3), a marker of the M-phase [30]. EdU labeling was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The number of cells per sphere was determined by counting the DAPI-labeled nuclei. EdU-, Ki67- or pHH3-positive cells were counted within the spheres of each genotype. For every marker, 100 spheres (50 spheres x 2 animals) were analyzed per group.\n\nViral transduction of the otosphere cultures\nThe OC specimens of C57Bl/6 mice were harvested at p0–p2. The OC specimens were dissociated, and the cell suspension was cultured in medium supplemented with growth factors, as described above. Two viral vectors (Vector BioLabs, Malvern, PA, USA) were used to transduce the cells in the otosphere cultures. Both vectors are recombinant adenoviruses with deletions in the E1 and E3 regions (Type 5 dE1/E3), rendering them replication-defective. To overexpress p16ink4a, an adenovirus was used to express both p16ink4a and GFP, each under a separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Ad-p16-GFP). The co-expression of p16ink4a and GFP enabled to mark the transduced cells, which overexpress p16ink4a, by visualizing GFP fluorescence. As a control, the cells were incubated with another adenoviral vector, which expresses GFP under the CMV promoter (Ad-GFP).\nFor the viral transduction experiments, the cells were incubated for 6DIV in 6-well multiwell plates with a cell-repellant surface (CELLSTAR®, Greiner Bio-one GmbH), with either the Ad-GFP or Ad-p16-GFP vectors. Each well contained 1 ml of medium, seeded with 50000 OC-derived cells. Both vectors were added at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) value of 100. After 5DIV, the spheres were counted by visual inspection under an inverted microscope with a 20x objective (Zeiss AG). At 5DIV, EdU (final concentration 10 μM) was added to the culture media for the last 24 hours of culture. At 6DIV, the spheres were fixed and labeled for DAPI and EdU. GFP fluorescence was directly observed under a fluorescence microscope (ApoTome.2, Zeiss AG), and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was considered as the transduction efficiency of both vectors. Under our culture conditions, the average transduction efficiency in the spheres was 28% for the Ad-GFP vector, and 32% for the Ad-p16-GFP vector.\n\nStatistical analysis\nqRT-PCR data and results from the otosphere assay were assessed using JMP (Version 9; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical comparisons were conducted relative to the biological reference group. For all experiments, the differences between experimental groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Normally distributed data were analyzed using either the Student’s t-test for the comparison of two groups, or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. For the quantification of cell cycle markers in otospheres, zero values were frequently obtained, which rendered the data distribution non-normal. For these experiments, non-parametric statistical testing was performed (the Dwass-Steel test for multiple comparisons).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164579/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003592","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Mature miRNAs can often be classified into large families, consisting of members with identical seeds (nucleotides 2 through 7 of the mature miRNAs) and highly homologous ∼21-nucleotide (nt) mature miRNA sequences. However, it is unclear whether members of a miRNA gene family, which encode identical or nearly identical mature miRNAs, are functionally interchangeable in vivo. Methods and Findings: We show that mir-181a-1, but not mir-181c, can promote CD4 and CD8 double-positive (DP) T cell development when ectopically expressed in thymic progenitor cells. The distinct activities of mir-181a-1 and mir-181c are largely determined by their unique pre-miRNA loop nucleotides—not by the one-nucleotide difference in their mature miRNA sequences. Moreover, the activity of mir-181a-1 on DP cell development can be quantitatively influenced by nucleotide changes in its pre-miRNA loop region. We find that both the strength and the functional specificity of miRNA genes can be controlled by the pre-miRNA loop nucleotides. Intriguingly, we note that mutations in the pre-miRNA loop regions affect pre-miRNA and mature miRNA processing, but find no consistent correlation between the effects of pre-miRNA loop mutations on the levels of mature miRNAs and the activities of the mir-181a-1/c genes. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that pre-miRNA loop nucleotides play a critical role in controlling the activity of miRNA genes and that members of the same miRNA gene families could have evolved to achieve different activities via alterations in their pre-miRNA loop sequences, while maintaining identical or nearly identical mature miRNA sequences.

Briefly, a ∼270-nt gene segment containing a ∼22-nt mature miRNA and ∼125-nt of genomic sequences flanking both sides of the miRNA was amplified from genomic DNA and placed in the U3 region of the 3′ LTR under the control of the human H1 pol III promoter [8], [9]. A GFP reporter driven by an independent murine 3-phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PPGK) was used as a marker for infection. mir-181a-1 and mir-181c mutant constructs were generated using an overlapping PCR strategy to introduce mutations in the stem and loop regions of the miRNA genes. All mutant constructs were validated by DNA sequencing (see Materials and Methods S1 for the wild-type and mutant gene sequences). For mutations in the miRNA stem regions, compensatory mutations were also introduced to the miR* strands to preserve the integrity of the stem and loop structures (Fig. S1). High-titer retroviral supernatant was generated by co-transfecting the miRNA expression vector and pCLeco packaging construct into BOSC 23 cells (293T-based viral packaging cell line).\n\nOP9-DL1 stromal co-culture assay for in vitro T cell differentiation\nSix-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were given a single intravenous dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 150 mg/kg body weight; SIGMA, St. Louis, Missouri) four days before culture initiation. All mice were maintained at the Stanford University School of Medicine animal facility and treated in accordance with the Stanford University Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. Thymocytes were isolated from the 5-FU primed-mice, infected with miRNA expression vectors by spinoculation, and seeded at 1×105 infected cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates containing a monolayer of OP9-DL1 stromal cells. For each viral construct, 12 independent culture replicates were seeded. The cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) Alpha Medium supplemented with 20% FCS, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 5 ng/ml IL-7, and 27.5 ng/ml Flk2/Flt3L for 24 hours and then the medium was changed to remove non-adherent thymocytes. The cultures were fed with fresh medium on day 6. After about 8–10 days of culturing, cells were harvested and stained for surface marker CD4, CD8, and CD45. The percentage of DP cells yielded from culture was quantified by flow cytometry. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were collected. Adherent cells were dissociated by treatment with collagenase type IV (0.8 mg/ml; Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) followed by forceful pipetting. The cells were then immunolabeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (clone RM4-5; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8a antibody (clone 53-6.7; BD Pharmingen) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for the expression of CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens. GFP positive thymocytes were distinguishable from GFP positive stromal cells by forward and side scatter gates and the intensity of green fluorescence. When the infection-rate was low, anti-CD45 antibody staining was used to gate out contaminating GFP+ OP9-DL1 cells. The appropriate dilution for each antibody was determined prior to use.\nBox-plots summarize the distribution of relative miRNA activity in DP cell development. The ends of the boxes define the 25th and 75th percentiles, a line indicates the median, and bars define the 5th and 95th percentiles. Individual outliers are also shown. The activities of mir-181a-1, mir-181c, and mutant genes in DP cell development were normalized so that the empty vector (negative control) had a median activity of “0” and mir-181a-1 expressing vector (positive control) had a median activity of “1.” The percentage of DP cells yielded from the co-culture assay varied between experiments, possibly due to the heterogeneous nature of the thymic progenitor cells and intrinsic variation between the batches of mice used. Therefore, such normalization is required to reset the baseline and allows the independent repeats to be compared. Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Tests were performed to determine whether the activities of mutants were statistically different from the control vector or the mir-181a-1 vector.\n\nCell culture and transfection\nAdherent BOSC 23 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% of pen/strep antibiotics, supplemented with glutamine. For northern and primer extension assays, BOSC 23 cells were plated at a density of 3.75×105 cells/well in a 6-well plate at 24 hours before transfection. Cells were transfected with 2 µg constructs expressing mir-181a-1, mir-181c, mutant genes, and control vector using Fugene transfection reagents (Roche).\n\nQuantitative Northern blot analyses\nQuantitative Northern blot analyses were used to determine the level of mature miRNA expression and processing of the pre-miRNA and mature miRNA. Total RNA was prepared from BOSC 23 cells transfected with constructs expressing mir-181a-1 or mir-181c, and their mutant genes, and loaded onto 15% PAGE gel (10 µg/sample). Since all of the miRNA expressing vectors contain an independent GFP reporter, the percentage of GFP positive cells were determined by FACS analyses and used to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Various amounts of synthetic mature miRNA were loaded onto the same gel to generate standard curves. Specific probes that perfectly matched mature miRNAs were used in hybridization to determine the expression of both mature and pre-miRNA species (see Materials and Methods S1 for probes sequences). Band intensity was determined by phosphoimager quantification. Blots were also probed with U6 probes to normalize loading. Exact copies/pg of total RNA were determined by comparing to the corresponding standard curve. Representative blots of three or more independent quantitative Northern blot analyses were shown. Standard curves and average results of three or more independent quantitative Northern blot analyses were summarized and plotted.\n\nPrimer Extension Analyses\nPrimer extension was used to map the 5′ ends of the mature miRNAs produced from the mir-181a-1/c mutant genes. Total RNA was prepared from BOSC 23 cells 48 hours after transfection with constructs expressing mir-181a-1, mir-181c, and their mutant genes. P32 labeled primer was mixed with appropriate RNA samples (10 µg total RNA) in the reaction buffer (1×RT reaction buffer with 0.25 mM of each dNTP), heated at 55°C for 20 minutes, and slowly cooled to 16°C to allow for annealing. The primer extension reaction was initiated by adding reverse transcriptase and then carried out at 16°C for 20 minutes, 42°C for 2 hours, and 85°C for 5 minutes. Samples were then resolved on a 15% denaturing PAGE gel. Synthetic miR-181a or miR-181c oligos in single nucleotide increments (15 nt–22/23 nt) were labeled and loaded onto the gel as size ladder. The primer extension results were visualized by overnight exposure to a phosphoimager screen (see Materials and Methods S1 for probes and DNA ladder sequences).\n\nmiRNA qPCR analyses\nIn the OP9-DL1 culture assay, mixed DN (CD4− CD8−) thymic progenitor cells differentiate into DP cells though multiple stages that are characterized by unique cell surface markers and complex molecular events. The DP cell population in the OP9-DL1 culture represents a relatively homogeneous population and can be isolated by FACS-sorting in reasonable quantity for miRNA qPCR analyses. In brief, GFP positive DP cells from OP9-DL1 co-culture assay were isolated by FACS-sorting (>94% pure). Synthetic miR-223 was spiked into sorted cells at the ratio of 100 pmol of miR-223 per 100,000 cells before RNA purification. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). We assumed that the ratio of spiked miR-223 to a miRNA of interest would not change during RNA purification. cDNA was then synthesized using miRNA-specific looped primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) and amplified with miRNA-specific forward primers, a TaqMan probe, and reverse primers (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification was performed in triplicate in an ABI-7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) at 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. To determine the exact copy number of a miRNA in sorted DP cells, we carried out absolute miRNA quantification with miRNA qPCR assay. Exact copies of test and spiked miRNAs in the defined amount of total RNA input were determined by using standard curves for mature miR-181a, miR-181c, and spiked miR-223. miR-181a or miR-181c expression was normalized using miR-15b as an endogenous loading control. Representative results of three miRNA qPCR analyses of independently-sorted, virally infected DP cells were shown. All reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003738/title","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003738/abstract","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053147/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003592/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003592/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003592/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003591","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nIndividual mice have a unique odor, or odortype, that facilitates individual recognition. Odortypes, like other phenotypes, can be influenced by genetic and environmental variation. The genetic influence derives in part from genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). A major environmental influence is diet, which could obscure the genetic contribution to odortype. Because odortype stability is a prerequisite for individual recognition under normal behavioral conditions, we investigated whether MHC-determined urinary odortypes of inbred mice can be identified in the face of large diet-induced variation. Mice trained to discriminate urines from panels of mice that differed both in diet and MHC type found the diet odor more salient in generalization trials. Nevertheless, when mice were trained to discriminate mice with only MHC differences (but on the same diet), they recognized the MHC difference when tested with urines from mice on a different diet. This indicates that MHC odor profiles remain despite large dietary variation. Chemical analyses of urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) are consistent with this inference. Although diet influenced VOC variation more than MHC, with algorithmic training (supervised classification) MHC types could be accurately discriminated across different diets. Thus, although there are clear diet effects on urinary volatile profiles, they do not obscure MHC effects.\n"],"title":"Genetically-Based Olfactory Signatures Persist Despite Dietary Variation","materials_and_methods":["\n\n\nMice\nThe mice were cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocols were previously approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Monell Chemical Senses Center (Approval number: 900 p).\nUrine donor mice and sensor mice trained in the Y maze were of the inbred strains C57BL/6J (B6: MHC type H2b) and its congenic partner strain C57BL/6J-H2k (B6-H2k: MHC type H2k). This pair of congenic strains is genetically identical except for the small chromosomal segment containing the MHC region. All mice used in these experiments were maintained in the same animal room on a 12∶12 h light∶dark cycle.\nUrine donors were all males from 20 B6 and 20 B6-H2k mice. B6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). B6-H2K mice were born in our laboratory. Sixteen sensor mice were used for the behavior experiments, 5 in Experiment 1 and 11 in Experiment 2. Of these, seven were B6-H2k and nine were B6. No differences in the trained responses of these two MHC types were observed as has been consistently found in our studies [20].\n\nDiets\nAll donor mice were initially fed laboratory rodent diet 5001 as purchased from Purina Mills (Diet L). Then, the 40 congenic mice (20 B6 mice and 20 B6-H2k) were divided into two equal groups of 20 mice/group each containing 10 B6 mice and 10 B6-H2k mice. One group of 20 mice continued to be fed the same diet whereas the other group was fed a semi-synthetic diet (5755: also purchased from Purina Mills, Diet S). This resulted in four groups of 10 donor mice each with a different combination of diet (L or S) and MHC type (B6 or B6-H2k). Diet L contained 23.4% crude protein and 4.5% fat. Its major ingredients were: corn, soybean meal, beet pulp, fish meal, oat, yeast, molasses, alfalfa meal, whey, wheat, porcine meat meal, animal fat preserved with BHT, minerals and vitamins. Diet S, a purified, semi-synthetic diet, had 19% protein and 10% fat. Its major ingredients were: dextrin, casein, sucrose, corn oil, lard, cellulose, minerals and vitamins. All trained odor sensor mice were maintained on Diet L.\nThe body weight for each donor mouse was recorded 50 days after the diet change. The different diets did not significantly affect body weight in the urine donors. B6 mice fed Diet L weighed 25.8±1.72 g, B6 mice fed Diet S weighed 26.3±2.47 g, B6-H2K mice fed Diet L weighed 24.62±3.42 g and B6-H2K mice fed Diet S weighed 26.35±2.25 g.\n\nUrine collection\nUrine donors were from 10 B6 mice fed Diet L, 10 B6 mice fed Diet S, 10 B6-H2k mice fed Diet L and 10 B6-H2k mice fed Diet S. However, a total of 37 mice were used for the urine collection because a B6 mouse fed Diet L and 2 B6-H2k mice fed Diet L died prior to the end of the experiment. Urine samples were collected individually from each mouse beginning 40 days after the diet change and continuing up to 120 days following the diet change. Voided mouse urine obtained by gentle abdominal pressure was collected directly into a sterile tube. After each collection, urine samples were frozen at −20 C until needed. For the behavioral testing, pairs of samples (each 0.3–0.4 ml) were defrosted and placed in two 3.5-cm-diameter Petri dishes.\n\nTraining mice in the Y-maze\nThe design and operation of the Y-maze apparatus used in studying odortypes are detailed elsewhere [33]. Briefly, the two arms of the maze were scented by air currents conducted through chambers containing urine in Petri dishes. For training and testing in the Y-maze, gates were raised and lowered in a timed sequence of up to 48 consecutive trials, paired urine samples being changed for each trial. During the training session, water-deprived sensor mice were rewarded with a drop of water for each correct response. After successful training (>80% concordance), unrewarded trials were interspersed, at an average frequency of one in four, with rewarded trials to accustom the mice to occasional absence of reward after a correct response. The mice performed with comparable accuracy during these trials. Mice were then tested in “generalization trials” with novel urine samples that were collected from mice with different diets and/or MHC types. This generalization procedure lends itself to blind testing of coded samples, because the operator of the maze is not required to supply reward for correct choices. Each day's training and testing in the Y-maze employed freshly-thawed urine samples maintained at room temperature.\n\nBehavior\n\nExperiment 1\nThis experiment was designed to investigate how mice that were trained to discriminate urines from mice that differed both in diet and MHC type generalized this training to choices between pairs of donors that differed only either in diet or in MHC type. Five adult female mice were trained. One B6 female and one B6-H2k female were rewarded in training for selecting the odor of B6 urine, fed on Diet S as opposed to B6-H2k urine fed on Diet L. Two B6 females and one B6-H2k female were rewarded in training for the alternative selection, B6-H2k urine, fed on Diet S as opposed to B6 urine fed on Diet L. Generalization trials were then instituted so as to test four pairs of choices wherein either only diet varied with MHC type held constant or MHC type varied while diet was held constant. Specifically, the pairs of choices were: 1) urine collected from B6-H2b males fed on Diet L compared with urine collected from B6-H2k males fed on Diet L (bL vs. kL); 2) B6-H2b males fed on Diet S from B6-H2k males fed on Diet S (bS vs. kS); 3) B6-H2b males fed on Diet L from B6-H2b males fed on Diet S (bL vs. bS); and 4) B6-H2k males fed on Diet L from B6-H2k males fed on Diet S (kL vs. kS).\n\nExperiment 2\nThe results of Experiment 1 provided no evidence that MHC type was detected when diet was varied. However, merely because the mice did not show behavioral recognition of MHC changes in the face of variation in diet does not mean that such cues were not there or that they might not be responded to in other circumstances. Thus the second behavioral experiment was designed to approach this issue differently. Here mice were trained to discriminate MHC congenic mice on one diet and their response to the same MHC difference in mice on a novel diet was tested. Three B6 males and two B6-H2k females were rewarded in training for selecting the odor of B6 urine, as opposed to B6-H2k urine fed on Diet L. Four B6 mice (three males and one female) and two B6-H2k females were rewarded in training for the alternative selection, B6-H2k urine as opposed to B6 urine fed on Diet L.\n\nChemistry\nThe 37 urine samples collected from each individual mouse were analyzed over a period of four days. The same SPME fiber and GC/MS were used for all analyses. The run order of the samples was randomized to minimize the analytical variability such as day to day instrumental drift, SPME fiber degradation, or ambient background differences and to ensure that comparisons between four groups were unbiased. Preliminary study also showed that there was no residual or solute cross-contamination effect between successive runs.\nThe method used to collect mouse urine VOCs by SPME and the parameters for the GC/MS have been described in detail elsewhere [6]. Briefly, two hundred microliters of mouse urine was placed in a 4-ml glass vial and the VOCs in the headspace sampled using a 2-cm, three-component SPME fiber (30 µm carboxen, 50 µm divinyl benzene, polydimethyl siloxane, Supelco Corp, Bellefonte, PA) at 37°C for 30 min. The SPME fiber containing the urinary VOCs was then inserted into the injection port of a Thermo-Finnigan Trace GC/MS (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) and desorbed for 5 min at 230°C. The GC/MS was equipped with a Stabilwax column (30 M×0.32 mm with 1.0 µ coating; Restek, Bellefonte, PA). Compound identification was accomplished through manual interpretation of mass spectra as well as matching unknowns against the NIST '02 library and comparison with commercially available standard samples when available. In addition, gas chromatographic relative retention times of all commercially available standards and mouse urine compounds were calculated relative to a series of fatty acid ethyl esters [34]. The compounds which were not commercially available, such as 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole, 2-isopropyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole and 2,3-dehydro-exo-brevicomin, were tentatively identified by comparison of their mass spectra to spectra in the NIST02 mass spectral library and in the published literature [35]–[37].\n\nData analysis\nRaw data files from the GC/MS system were initially processed in Matlab (version 7.0.1, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) to detect chemical components and to quantify their relative peak areas, following the general approach outlined in Willse et al. [20]. Briefly, components were detected on the basis of concomitantly peaking single ion chromatograms (SICs), because apparent peaks in TICs generally conceal multiple distinct compounds in complex mixtures like urine. For each ion trace, peaks were determined jointly across all 37 chromatograms. First, SIC peaks were detected independently for each sample, then peak locations aggregated or combined across samples into ‘consensus’ peak locations using kernel density estimation, which allows for small variations in retention times between chromatograms. Each detected component was characterized by a set of concomitantly peaking m/z values. For quantification, only m/z values were used that are well separated from neighboring peaks in their respective ion traces. Intensity values (peak areas) for components were log-transformed and organized into an N×C table, where N is the number of samples and C is the number of detected components. Mass spectra were manually examined and compared to characteristic masses determined in pre-processing, and compounds identified where possible. All subsequent analyses were conducted using the freely available R software for statistical computing [38; version 2.0.1].\nThe following statistical model was fit separately for each compound to assess the effects of MHC and diet on relative compound concentration:(1)where Yijk is normalized compound concentration, μ is the overall average, τi is the relative effect of MHC type i (i = 1,2 corresponding to B6 and B6-H2K), βj is the relative effect of diet j (j = 1,2 corresponding to Diet L and Diet S), and (τβ)ij is an interaction effect describing the extent to which the MHC effect τi depends on diet effect βj. A significant interaction suggests that mice of different MHC types respond metabolically differently to different diets. The random error term εijk captures all other unexplained variation, and is assumed to have mean 0 and variance σ2.\nAlthough the term (τβ)ij in model [1] captures the interaction effect between diet and MHC, an individual interaction effect, if present, can be difficult to interpret because some interactions can be removed simply by re-scaling the data [39]. Statistical analyses in this study were performed on log-transformed peak areas, because the variance is stabilized (i.e., constant as a function of intensity) on this scale for these data. The scale at which odorants are perceived and acted on is generally not known. We therefore focus on crossover or qualitative interactions because of their unambiguous interpretation: crossover interactions cannot be removed by rescaling the data. For details of crossover interactions, see Method S1 and Figure S1.\nMultivariate statistical methods were used to assess the overall salience of MHC and diet. Redundancy analysis [40] was used to decompose multivariate chromatographic profiles into their constituent sources of systematic variability corresponding to MHC, Diet, and MHC×Diet to determine which contributes most to overall variability. This is a generalization of variability decomposition performed separately for each compound, accounting for correlated (redundant) compound profiles.\nDecision tree classification methodology [41] was used to construct a recursive decision tree designed to classify a sample to one of the four treatment groups based solely on its chromatogram. The decision tree produces a sequence of criteria by which a population is successively subdivided based on intensity values of certain compounds. It is expected that initial population divisions (i.e., those at the top of tree) will be based on the most salient characteristics of the population, so that in this case examination of the classification tree will provide insight into the relative salience of MHC and diet. (The term salience here refers to chemical salience not perceptual salience.) Classification trees were also used to assess how well MHC types can be classified across different diets.\nTo measure the importance of an individual variable (compound), Gini indexes are compared for a tree containing the variable to a tree obtained by permuting the variable. The Gini index is a measure of variability computed for each node in a decision tree, and will be 0 for a node that contains all observations assigned to same group (i.e., MHC type). For node n, let P_n1 be proportion of observations belonging to Group 1, and P_n2 be proportion belonging to group 2. Then Gini index for that node (for the 2 group case we are considering) is P_n1*(1-P_n1)+P_n2*(1-P_n2). For important variables there will be a significant increase in Gini indexes when a variable is permuted.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/references","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/body","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/introduction","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006738/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS Genetics"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is usually applied as boost radiotherapy for superficial residual of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary extern-beam radiptherapy (ERT).

Methodology/Principal Findings: Two hundred and thirteen patients with residual NPC who were salvaged with brachytherapy boost radiation during 2005–2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these patients, 171 patients had superficial residual NPC (≤1 cm below the nasopharyngeal epithelium) were treated with ICBT boost radiation, and interstitial IMBT boost radiation was delivered to 42 patients with deep-seated residual NPC (>1 cm below the nasopharyngeal epithelium). We found that IMBT boost subgroup had a higher ratio of T2b (81.0% VS 34.5%, P<0.001) and stage II (90.5% VS 61.4%, P = 0.001) than that of ICBT boost subgroup. The dosage of external-beam radiotherapy in the nasopharyngeal (63.0±3.8 VS 62.6±4.3 Gray (Gy), P = 0.67) and regional lymph nodes (55.8±5.0 VS 57.5±5.7 Gy, P = 0.11) was comparable in both groups. For brachytherapy, IMBT subgroup had a lower boost radiation dosage than ICBT subgroup (11.0±2.9 VS 14.8±3.2 Gy, P<0.01). Though the IMBT group had deeper residual tumors and received lower boost radiation dosages, both subgroups had the similar 5-year actuarial overall survival rate (IMBT VS ICBT group: 96.8% VS 93.6%, P = 0.87), progression-free survival rate (92.4% VS 86.5%, P = 0.41) and distant metastasis-free survival rate (94.9% VS 92.7%, P = 0.64). Moreover, IMBT boost radiation subgroup had a similar local (97.4% VS 94.4%, P = 0.57) and regional (95.0% VS 97.2%, P = 0.34) control to ICBT subgroup. The acute and late toxicities rates were comparable between the both subgroups. Conclusions/Significance: IMBT boost radiation may be a promising therapeutic selection for deep-seated residual NPC.

For IMRT, the prescribed dose was 68–72 Gy/30–33 fractions to the GTVnx and 60–66 Gy/30–33 fractions to the GTVnd.The radiotherapy was administrated daily from Monday to Friday.\n\nBrachytherapy administration\nBoost radiation to the residual primary tumor sites would be withheld unless the biopsy remained positive at 10 or more weeks after external radiotherapy. The IMBT boost was delivered to the residual malignancy within the limited areas, including of the upper margin: the skull base bone; the lower margin: the inferior border of the second cervical vertebra; the anterior margin: the postnaris; the posterior margin: the prevertebral fascia; the anterolateral margin: the medial pterygoid plate; the posterolateral margin: the internal carotid artery. The IMBT boost radiation was administered as following: 1) the Obturators were bended to a suitable angle to fit the tumor configuration, and then inserted the 6F sharp Obturator into the applicator (OncoSmart ProGuide Needles) (Figure 1A); 2) under guidance of 4-mm rigid sinus endoscope (Karl-Storz, Germany), the obturator/applicator was inserted into the lidocaine anaesthetized residual tumor (Figure 1A and 1B) and scanned by computed tomography (Figure 1C); 3) after pulling out the obturator, the applicators were placed using the Radio Opaque Button on the nose wings (Figure 1B and 1C).\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090048.g001Figure 1\nEndoscopic-guided IMBT boost administration process.\n(A) The instruments and applicators used in endoscopic-guided IMBT boost process.

The red arrow indicated the 100% isodose curve covering the whole GTV. (E) The 3-dimensional reconstruction image of two applicators (outlined by hepta-prism) inserting into the nasopharyngeal residue (outlined by red fine grid lines) in coronal section. MSta was referred to the maximum spacing from the tumor margin to the nearest applicator (blue arrows), and MSaa was referred to minimum distance between two applicators (green arrow). (F) A representative case that was delivering the IMBT boost. The crimson arrow denoted the applicator outline, and white arrow displayed the 6F sharp Obturator with 0 and 30 degree angle. The yellow arrow indicated the Radio Opaque Button.\n\nThe following 3 obturator/applicator implantation principles were adhered: 1) two to four applicators were used for further dosage optimization; (2) the obturator/applicator angle was less than 30 degrees to avoid obstruction of the radiation source (192Ir); (3) the obturator/applicator implantation pathway deviated from internal carotid artery to avoid an accidental injury.\nPrior to the brachytherapy boost, CT simulation was performed extending from the sellar base to the second cervical vertebra with a slice thickness of 2 mm (Figure 1C). The accuracy of implantation was assessed by evaluating the maximum distance from the tumor margin to the nearest applicator (MDta), and maximum distance between nearby applicators (MDaa). The implantation was acceptable when MDta was ≤1.0 cm and MDaa ≤2.0 cm. Moreover, the tumor target zone and sensitive organs were delineated on each CT slice using the PLATO brachytherapy planning system (Version 14.2.6, Nucletron, Veenendaal, Netherlands). In the planning process, the dosage distribution was optimized to ensure GTV might be covered completely, while the nearby important organs were exposed to less than 20–50% of maximum dosage (Figure 1D and 1E).\nThe MicroSelectron 192Ir, with the 0.9 mm total diameter and 3.6 mm length, High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy System (Nucletron, Netherlands) was used to deliver ICBT and IMBT boost radiation (Figure 1F). For ICBT boost, the applicator would be pulled out after each radiation fraction, whereas would be sustained to all fractions in IMBT boost to avoid repeated implanting. The ICBT boost fraction of 3–5 Gy was delivered daily, and IMBT boost fraction of 2–3 Gy was delivered twice daily at 6–8 hours interval.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe survival rate was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the differences between groups were compared using the log-rank test. All events were measured from the date of brachytherapy. Additionally, Cox multivariate model was used to evaluate the prognostic effect of brachytherapy boost radiation on OS, PFS, LRFS, RRFS, and DMFS. A two-tailed P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090048/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006737","journal":"PLOS Genetics","abstract":["\nIn Neurospora crassa, the transcription factor COL-26 functions as a regulator of glucose signaling and metabolism. Its loss leads to resistance to carbon catabolite repression. Here, we report that COL-26 is necessary for the expression of amylolytic genes in N. crassa and is required for the utilization of maltose and starch. Additionally, the Δcol-26 mutant shows growth defects on preferred carbon sources, such as glucose, an effect that was alleviated if glutamine replaced ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. This rescue did not occur when maltose was used as a sole carbon source. Transcriptome and metabolic analyses of the Δcol-26 mutant relative to its wild type parental strain revealed that amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, the TCA cycle and GABA shunt were adversely affected. Phylogenetic analysis showed a single col-26 homolog in Sordariales, Ophilostomatales, and the Magnaporthales, but an expanded number of col-26 homologs in other filamentous fungal species. Deletion of the closest homolog of col-26 in Trichoderma reesei, bglR, resulted in a mutant with similar preferred carbon source growth deficiency, and which was alleviated if glutamine was the sole nitrogen source, suggesting conservation of COL-26 and BglR function. Our finding provides novel insight into the role of COL-26 for utilization of starch and in integrating carbon and nitrogen metabolism for balanced metabolic activities for optimal carbon and nitrogen distribution.\nAuthor summary: In nature, filamentous fungi sense nutrient availability in the surrounding environment and adjust their metabolism for optimal utilization, growth and reproduction. Carbon and nitrogen are two of major elements required for life. Within cells, signals from carbon and nitrogen catabolism are integrated, resulting in balanced metabolic activities for optimal carbon and nitrogen distribution. However, coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism is often missed in studies that are based on comparisons between single carbon or nitrogen sources. In this study, we performed systematic transcriptional profiling of Neurospora crassa on different components of starch and identified the transcription factor COL-26 to be an essential regulator for starch utilization and needed for coordinating carbon and nitrogen regulation and metabolism. Proteins with sequence similar to COL-26 widely exist among ascomycete fungi. Here we provide experimental evidence for shared function of a col-26 ortholog in Trichoderma reesei. Our finding provides novel insight into how the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism can be integrated in filamentous fungi by the function of COL-26 and which may aid in the rational design of fungal strains for industrial purposes. "],"title":"A fungal transcription factor essential for starch degradation affects integration of carbon and nitrogen metabolism","materials_and_methods":["\nStrains\nN. crassa Δcol-26 (FGSC 11031) and Δgln-1 (FGSC 19959) were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (http://www.fgsc.net/). The Pgpd-col-26; Δcol-26 strain was constructed by transforming the Δcol-26 mutant with a DNA fragment containing the A. nidulans gpdA promoter, the open reading frame and 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of col-26, and flanking regions homologous to the upstream and downstream genomic sequence of the csr-1 gene. Transformants were selected for resistance for cyclosporin [61] and tested for genotypes by diagnostic PCR. The transformants with positive results were backcrossed to FGSC 2489 to obtain a csr-1::PgpdA-col-26; Δcol-26 homokaryotic strain.\nThe T. reesei ΔbglR mutants were created by transforming protoplasts of an uridine auxotrophic strain made from QM6a (Δpyr-4) [46] with two split-marker DNA fragments using method described in [62]. One of the split-marker fragment contains a ~1 kbp sequence homologous to upstream genomic sequence of the bglR gene followed by the promoter and the first half of the pyr-4 coding sequence and the other contained the second half the pyr-4 coding sequence with ~400 bp of overlap sequence with the first half of the pyr-4 coding sequence and a ~1 kb sequence homologous to the downstream genomic sequence of the bglR gene. Transformants were first grown on the plates with minimal media and subsequently transferred to PDA plates for conidiation. Conidia were tested for correct integration of the pyr-4 gene at the bglR locus using diagnostic PCR. The strains with the bglR gene disrupted were subjected to single colony purification. Three verified ΔbglR homokaryotic strains were used for downstream analysis.\n\nCulture conditions\nN. crassa cultures were grown on slants, each with 3 mL of Vogel’s minimal medium (VMM) with 2% sucrose [17] and 2% agar, at 30°C in dark for 24 hours, followed by 4–10 days in constant light at 25°C to stimulate conidia production. For growth phenotype testing in 24-well plates, conidia were inoculated at 106/ml into 3 mL of VMM with selected carbon and nitrogen sources in 24-well plates covered with breathable rayon film seal, and the culture were grown at 25°C in constant light with shaking at 200 rpm. The film was taken off before imaging. At least two replicates were included in each experiment and the same experiments were done at least twice.\nFor mycelial biomass measurement, conidia were inoculated at 106/ml into 100 mL of VMM with selected carbon and nitrogen sources and grown at 25°C in constant light with shaking at 200 rpm. For crosses, one parental strain was grown on plates with synthetic crossing medium [63] for 2 weeks at room temperature for protoperithecial development. Conidia of the other parental strain were added to the plates for fertilization. Plates were kept for 3 weeks at room temperature. Ascospores were collected and activated as described [64], plated on VMM with 1% sucrose, and incubated at room temperature for 18 hrs. Germinated ascospores were transferred to VMM slants supplemented with cyclosporin or hygromycin B and screened for desired genotypes by diagnostic PCR.\nT. reesei cultures were grown in either minimal media [65] for selecting transformants or with PDA for conidiation. For growth phenotype testing, conidia were inoculated at 106/ml into 3 mL minimal media with a selected carbon source in 24-well plates, and the culture were grown at 28°C in dark with shaking at 200 rpm.\n\nMedia shift experiments\nFor RNA-seq experiments on VMM with 2% (w/v) maltose and metabolite analyses, conidia were inoculated at 106 conidia/mL into 3 mL VMM with 2% cellobiose and grown at 25°C in constant light and shaking at 200 rpm for 28 hrs. The mycelial biomass was washed twice with VMM-NC, followed by 18 hrs of incubation in VMM-NC. Mycelia were then transferred to VMM with maltose and grown 5.5 hrs for RNA-seq experiments, or transferred to VMM or VMM(Glu) with 2% (w/v) glucose and grown 5.5 hrs for metabolite profiling experiments.\nFor RNA-seq experiments on VMM with other carbon sources, conidia were inoculated at 106 conidia/mL into 3 mL VMM with 2% sucrose and grown at 25°C in constant light and shaking at 200 rpm for 16 hrs. The mycelial biomass was washed twice with VMM-NC and then transferred to VMM with the selected carbon sources for 4 hrs prior to RNA extraction. Concentrations of carbon sources were glycerol (2 mM), fructose (2 mM), mannose (2 mM), trehalose (2 mM), sorbose (2 mM), xylose (2 mM), sucrose (2% w/v), cellobiose (2 mM), maltose (2 mM), avicel (1% w/v), amylose (1% w/v), amylopectin (1% w/v), xyloglucan (1% w/v).\n\nRNA-seq experiments, data processing and analyses\nMycelia of cultures were harvested by filtration and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and further purified using RNeasy kits (QIAGEN). RNA-seq libraries of WT and Δcol-26 from 2% (w/v) maltose were prepared at the Functional Genomics Lab, a QB3-Berkeley Core Research Facility at UC Berkeley and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Lab. Other libraries were prepared and sequenced at JGI as part of the Neurospora ENCODE CSP project. Total RNA starting material was 1 μg per sample and 10 cycles of PCR was used for library amplification. The prepared libraries were then quantified using KAPA Biosystem’s next-generation sequencing library qPCR kit and run on a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. The quantified libraries were then multiplexed into pools of 9 libraries, and the pool was then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform utilizing a TruSeq paired-end cluster kit, v3, and Illumina’s cBot instrument to generate a clustered flowcell for sequencing. Sequencing of the flowcell was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit, v3, following a 1x100 indexed run recipe.\nThe sequencing reads that passed filtering from the CASAVA 1.8 FASTQ files were subjected to quality score checking using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Only reads with all bases scoring greater than 22 were used to map against predicted transcripts from the N. crassa OR74A genome v12 (Neurospora crassa Sequencing Project, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT http://www.broadinstitute.org/) with Tophat v2.0.4 [66]. The output bam files were sorted and indexed using the SAMtools package [67] and the indexed files were visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer [68]. Transcript abundance reflected in FPKM was estimated with Cufflinks v2.0.2 [66] mapping against reference isoforms. Profiling data are available at the GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; Series Record GSE GSE92848 and GSE95350). For differential gene expression analysis, the bam files were first processed using the HTSeq package v0.6.0 [69] to generate raw counts, and the raw counts are subjected to differential analysis using the DESeq2 package version 1.10.1 [70].\nThe FungiFun2 online resource tool was used in functional enrichment analysis (https://elbe.hki-jena.de/fungifun/fungifun.php) [71]. The gene to category associations was tested for over-representation using hypergeometric distribution and the probability for false discovery rate was controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.\n\nMetabolite extraction\nMycelia from 3 mL cultures in 24-well plates were harvested by filtration followed by a quick wash in distilled water. Half of biological replicates were used for metabolite extraction and the other half were dried for biomass measurement. Washed mycelia for metabolite extraction were quickly put into a tube containing 200 μL zirconia beads (0.5 mm) and 500 μL extraction buffer (80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.1 M formic acid) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80°C until extraction before mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. For metabolite extraction, the frozen samples were immediately put in a bead-beater (BioSpec) and homogenized for 1 min, and cooled on ice. The homogenate were centrifuged at 4°C at 14 000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatants were subjected to either GC-MS or LC-MS analysis.\nFor GC-MS analysis, 20 μL of the supernatant was collected and transferred to 1.5 mL micro-tubes containing 50 μL internal standard solution (d27-Myristic acid in methanol, 250 μM). Samples were dried under reduced pressure using a speedvac (Savant). Samples were derivatized for GC-MS analysis according to the method of Kind et al [72]. Briefly, 10 μL of methoxyamine hydrochloride dissolved in pyridine (40 mg/mL) was added to each dried sample, and shaken at 30°C at maximum speed for 90 min using a thermomixer (Eppendorf). A mixture of retention time marker standards were prepared by dissolving fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of different linear chain lengths in chloroform (C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16 FAMES at 0.8 mg/ml, and C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28, C30 at 0.4 mg/ml). The FAME mixture (20 μL) was added to 1 mL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilytrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), and 90 μL of the FAMEs/MSTFA solution was added to each sample. Samples were shaken at 37°C at maximum speed in a thermomixer for 30 min, and then transferred to and sealed in amber GC-MS sample vials containing glass inserts (Agilent). Extraction blanks were prepared following the above procedure but starting with empty Eppendorf tubes.\nFor LC-MS analysis, supernatant (350 μL) was collected and filtered through 0.2 μm spin filters (Pall) by centrifugation for 1 min at 14000 rpm. Fifty μL of the filtrate was transferred to HPLC vials containing 50 μL of an internal standard mixture solution. Samples were kept at 4°C in the LC-MS autosampler chamber. Extraction blanks were prepared in triplicate by following the above sample preparation procedure with empty microtubes.\n\nMetabolite profiling, data acquisition and analyses\nFor GC-MS analysis, samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) connected to an Agilent 5977 single quadrupole mass spectrometer, all controlled by Agilent GC-MS MassHunter Acquisition software. Samples were injected using a Gerstel automatic liner exchange MPS system (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany) controlled by Maestro software. Sample injection volume was 2 μL, and the injector was operated in splitless mode. Samples were injected into the 50°C injector port which was ramped to 270°C in a 12°C/s thermal gradient and held for 3 min. The gas chromatograph was fitted with a 30m long, 0.25mm ID Rtx5Sil-MS column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA), 0.25 mm 5% diphenyl film with a 10 m integrated guard column. Initial oven temperature was set at 50°C, and the over program was as follows: ramp at 5°C/min to 65°C, held for 0.2 min; ramp at 15°C/ min to 80°C, held for 0.2 min; ramp at 15°C/min to 310°C, hold for 12 min. The mass spectrometer transfer line and ion source temperature was 250°C and 230°C, respectively. Electron ionization was at 70 eV and mass spectra were acquired from 50 to 700 m/z at 8 spectra per second. Raw data was visually inspected using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Agilent MassHunter Unknowns Analysis software v. B.07.00 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to perform peak deconvolution and library matching. A library match score was calculated for using FAME markers for retention time calibration, and matching mass fragmentation spectra to those in the Fiehn GC-MS Metabolomics RTL Library [72]. Metabolites of interest were only included in further analysis if their library match scores were greater than 75%. The identities of some metabolites with scores lower than 90% were confirmed by comparing mass spectra and retention times with that of authentic reference standards (S6 Table). Mass spectral and retention time data from identified target metabolites were used to make an analysis method in MassHunter Quantitative Analysis Software for GCMS (v.B.07.00). For each metabolite, a quantifier ion and two qualifier ions were defined to produce an extracted ion chromatogram in a specified retention time window. Integration of the extracted ion chromatogram peaks yielded peak areas that were further normalized by the mean of dry fungal biomass from biological replicates. The normalized peak areas were used for comparing the relative abundance of metabolites across samples.\nTargeted LC-MS analysis was performed for select metabolites not detected by GC-MS (S7 Table). Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 6550 ESI-QTOF LCMS fitted with a Merck SeQuant Zic-HILIC column (150 x 1 mm, 3.5 mm, 100 Å) with a guard column. Mobile phase consisted of 5% ammonium acetate in water (solvent A), and 5% ammonium acetate in water-acetonitrile (10:90) (solvent B). The following LC solvent time-table was used: 0 min, 100% B; 1.5 min, 100% B; 25 min, 50% B; 26 min, 35% B; 32 min, 35% B; 33 min, 100% B; 40 min, 100% B. Flow rate: 0.25 ml/min; injection volume: 2 μL. Each sample was analyzed in positive and negative ionization mode. Raw data was analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative analysis. Extracted ion chromatograms were produced from raw scan data using calculated m/z values for target metabolites, corresponding to their molecular ion and potential adducts: (M+H)+, (M+Na)+, (M+K)+ for Positive mode; (M-H)-, (M+COOH)-, (M+CH3COOH)- for Negative mode. The identity of detected ions were confirmed by comparing retention time with reference standards, or checked by performing MS/MS analysis of the target ion, and comparing ion fragments with those in the METLIN online database. Integration of the extracted ion chromatogram peaks yielded peak areas that were further normalized by the mean of dry fungal biomass from biological replicates. Normalized peak areas were used for comparing the relative abundance of target metabolites across samples.\nFor differential metabolite analysis, the normalized peak areas were log transformed and then used in the independent t-test of hypothesis that there is no difference between WT and the mutant. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significantly different and values between 0.05 and 0.1 were interpreted as indicating a trend toward statistical significance. Four biological replicates measured by GC-MS and two biological replicates measured by LC-MS were used in differential analysis. All metabolites that were found to be either significantly different or with a trend toward statistical significance were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis.\nHierarchical clustering analysis is performed with Cluster 3.0 [73] using log transformed mean of normalized peak areas from biological replicates. The values were centered to the mean across different growth conditions and normalized on a per metabolite basis. Average linkage clustering was performed with Euclidean distance as the similarity metric.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of putative col-26 orthologs\nProtein sequences of selected ascomycetes were downloaded from JGI Mycosm [74] and used to construct a local protein database using the NCBI BLAST+ application (version 2.2.31) (S5 Table). The putative COL26 orthologs were searched in the database using BLASTP with a cut-off E value less than e-20. All hits were tested by reciprocally BLASTP against the N. crassa database and only ones that resulted in COL26 as the best hit were retained for protein sequence alignment. Protein sequences of the putative COL26 orthologs from selected species were aligned using three different programs: Clustal Omega [75], MAFFT [76], and MUSCLE [77], and the best alignment was chosen and further trimmed using trimAl [78]. The trimmed alignment file was used for phylogenetic tree construction by the RAxML program with 200 bootstraps [79]. The result were visualized and edited in iTOL (http://itol.embl.des/) [80].\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164568/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164568/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164568/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164568/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/title","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/abstract","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/references","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/body","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000467/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0090034/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003570","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that consists of a polyhedral protein shell filled with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Methodology/Principal Findings: To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into α-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly, a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO assembles empty carboxysome shells of apparently normal shape and composition. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that carboxysome shell architecture is not determined by the enzyme they normally sequester. Our study provides, for the first time, clear evidence that carboxysome contents can be manipulated and suggests future nanotechnological applications that are based upon engineered protein microcompartments.

The culture medium and growth conditions were as described previously [6]. Growth of wild type and mutant cells was monitored by measuring the OD600.\n\nConstruction of RubisCO mutants\nPrimers used to amplify the carboxysomal (C) and noncarboxysomal (NC) Form I RubisCO from Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2 (Tc) and the kanamycin resistance (kanr) cassette are listed in Table S1. Briefly, genes encoding the carboxysomal RubisCO (large subunit GenBank CP000109, GeneID: 3760532; small subunit GenBank CP000109, GeneID: 3760533) and noncarboxysomal RubisCO (large subunit GenBank CP000109, GeneID: 3761246; small subunit GenBank CP000109, GeneID: 3761247) were amplified from Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting insert was excised by digestion with BamHI and KpnI, and ligated along with a kanr cassette containing KpnI–XhoI ends into the BamHI–XhoI sites of the pPROEX-HTb vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was digested with BamHI and XhoI to release the insert. Escherichia coli DY330 cells [40] were co-transformed with this fragment and with pUC18 containing the cbbL-cbbS region of the H. neapolitanus cso operon to replace the wild type cbbL-cbbS region on the plasmid with that of the insert by homologous recombination. The resulting plasmid containing the mutated cbbL-cbbS region was electroporated into exponentially growing H. neapolitanus cells using the method of English et al. [12]. The presence of the desired changes in the cso operon of the H. neapolitanus mutants was confirmed by genomic sequencing (University of Maine DNA Sequencing Facility) and by PCR amplification.\n\nProtein analyses\nProtein samples were resolved on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and stained with GelCode Blue. For detection of RubisCO large subunit, blots were probed with commercially available chicken polyclonal anti-RbcL IgY antibodies as primary antibody. Form II RubisCO (CbbM) and the CsoS1 shell proteins were detected using a commercial rabbit polyclonal anti-CbbM and polyclonal anti-CsoS1 antibodies generated in our laboratory, respectively. The secondary antibodies were tagged with horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed using the One-Step NBT-BCIP reagent.\n\nElectron microscopy\nElectron micrographs of wild type and mutant carboxysomes were taken as described previously [6] and scanned on an Epson Perfection V700 Photo flatbed scanner.\n\nCO2 fixation assays\nCarboxysomes from wild type and mutant cells grown as 1.5 L batch cultures in air supplemented with 5% CO2 were isolated as described previously [24].

African cichlid fishes, with their array of closely related species that underwent a rapid dietary niche radiation, offer a particularly interesting system to explore the relative contribution of these two factors in nature. Here we surveyed the host intra- and interspecific natural variation of the gut microbiota of five cichlid species from the monophyletic tribe Perissodini of lake Tanganyika, whose members transitioned from being zooplanktivorous to feeding primarily on fish scales. The outgroup riverine species Astatotilapia burtoni, largely omnivorous, was also included in the study. Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria represented the dominant components in the gut microbiota of all 30 specimens analysed according to two distinct 16S rRNA markers. All members of the Perissodini tribe showed a homogenous pattern of microbial alpha and beta diversities, with no significant qualitative differences, despite changes in diet. The recent diet shift between zooplantkon- and scale-eaters simply reflects on a significant enrichment of Clostridium taxa in scale-eaters where they might be involved in the scale metabolism. Comparison with the omnivorous species A. burtoni suggests that, with increased host phylogenetic distance and/or increasing herbivory, the gut microbiota begins differentiating also at qualitative level. The cichlids show presence of a large conserved core of taxa and a small set of core OTUs (average 13–15%), remarkably stable also in captivity, and putatively favoured by both restricted microbial transmission among related hosts (putatively enhanced by mouthbrooding behavior) and common host constraints. This study sets the basis for a future large-scale investigation of the gut microbiota of cichlids and its adaptation in the process of the host adaptive radiation.\n"],"title":"Gut Microbiota Dynamics during Dietary Shift in Eastern African Cichlid Fishes","materials_and_methods":["\nSample collection\nIn June and July 2011 we sampled five cichlid species belonging to the tribe Perissodini from wild populations of the southern tip of lake Tanganyika (at the border between Zambia and Tanzania): the two zooplanktivorous species Haplotaxodon microlepis (designated as Hapmic, following [36]), and H. trifasciatus (Haptri); and the three scale-eaters, Plecodus straeleni (Plestr), Perissodus microlepis (Permic) and P. eccentricus (Perecc) (S1 Table). The two shallow-water Haplotaxodon species largely feed on the pelagic shrimp Mysis sp. and partly on planktonic algae and crustaceans, diatoms and cupeid fry. P. microlepis and P. straeleni are the two most common scale-eaters in the lake and coexist in shallow rocky habitats while P. eccentricus inhabits deep waters. P. microlepis and P. eccentricus feed almost exclusively on scales, and occasionally skin tissues; in P. straeleni scales account for approximately 90% of its diet, integrated by fish skin and fry (for details on gut content and stable isotopes see [42] and [36]). A schematic host phylogenetic tree is represented in S1 Fig\nWe also sampled a member of the tribe Tropheini, A. burtoni, a species from an inflow river, including both a wild and an inbreed laboratory population kept in the lab for at least ten generations (Astbur and AstburLAB, respectively). According to stable isotopes and gut content analysis, A. burtoni is omnivorous, but largely feeds on algae and plants [36]. Lab diet consisted of flake food twice a day and frozen artemia once a day.\nFor most species we individually profiled the gut microbiota of five individuals, with the exception of Haptri (four individuals) and Perecc (one individual) (S1 Table). All wild conspecifics were captured in the same locality, except for Plestr, whose specimens came from three distinct sites (geographically nearby). Specimens were trapped in nets and processed within an hour from catch. Full fish specimens were preserved in ethanol 100%, with their ventral side cut-opened for facilitating ethanol flow to internal organs. All sampling procedures in Lake Tanganyika and experimental manipulations in situ followed strict ethical guidelines and were approved as part of obtaining the field permits issued by the Lake Tanganyika Research Unit, Department of Fisheries, Mpulungu, Republic of Zambia, taking into account the 3Rs strategy (Reduction, Replacement, Refinement).\nSpecimens of AstburLAB came from an individual tank with standardized conditions of constant water temperature of 26°C, pH 7, and a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. Specimens were euthanized with MS 222 using approved procedures (permit nr. 2317, issued by the cantonal veterinary office from Switzerland) and directly processed for DNA extractions.\nIt is worth mentioning that in all cases we specifically sampled only adult individuals; because the dynamics of the cichlid gut microbiota through life stages are unknown, we assume their gut microbiota to be relatively stable at adult stage, according to study in humans [44].\nAll experiments were approved by the cantonal veterinary office from Switzerland and by the University of Basel veterinary office (permit nr. 1010H). The institution has been approved as research unit according to EU guideline 92/65/EWG (nr. CH-I-BS017) and CITES (nr. CH018).\n\nDNA extractions and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing\nAll cichlid species in this study are relatively small allowing sampling and easy processing of the whole guts. The entire digestive tracts, including stomachs, were dissected: stomach content was carefully flushed out with sterile water, while intestine content was left untouched. This procedure maximizes the representation of gut microbes, including those from the epithelial mucus layer, despite putatively including some transient bacteria through ingesta.\nDNA was extracted from individual guts using a modified version of a repeated beat-beating plus column (RBB+C) protocol [45]. Specifically, gut tissues were transferred to 800 μl lysis buffer with 0.3 gr. of 0.1 mm zirconia-silica beads, then homogenized with a FastaPrep bead beater (MP Biomedicals) at 5.0 M/S, 2x 45 sec and incubated at 70°C for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and supernatant stored separately. After addition of 400 μl lysis buffer, pellet was bead-beaded once more for 45 sec and supernatants were combined. Approximately 20–25 μl of proteinase K (to a final of 10 mg/mL) were added to the supernatant followed by incubation at 55°C for 45 min. Residues were eliminated with ammonium acetate (to a final of 2.5 M) and DNA precipitated with isopropanol and standard ethanol washes. DNA was diluted in TE (pH 7.0) and cleaned with Qiagen columns (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit).\nSpecies taxonomic classification was confirmed by amplification of the mitochondrial gene D-loop with primers L-PRO-F/TDK-D and sequence comparison against published sequences in Genbank.\nTwo 16S rRNA fragments were sequenced with the titanium LIB-L kit for unidirectional pyrosequencing (454/Roche) using slightly modified standard primer pairs 8F/519R and 356F/1064R, which amplify regions V1–V3 and V3–V5, respectively (S2 Table). To avoid hairpins formation between primers and barcodes, all barcodes-forward primers combinations were previously checked for intra-folding structures using mFold application (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold) and the 10 best combinations were chosen. PCR was performed on a 20 μl-volume using 1X of Qiagen Multiplex PCR kit, including HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase, 0.2 μM of primer and 1 μl of DNA (around 100–150 ng/ μL). Conditions were set to 15 min at 95°C, followed by 32 cycles of 45 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at 58°C and 1 min 30 sec at 72°C, plus final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Each sample was amplified in three replicates, plus a negative control (water only) and amplicons combined. Amplicon size and concentration were checked on Bioanalyzer (2100 Agilent Technologies).\nFor each 16S amplicon, specimens were individually barcoded and pooled at equimolar concentration in three 454 libraries (ten barcodes each library) after purification with AMPure beads (Agencourt Beckman Coulter) (S2 Table). Conspecifics were partitioned across libraries to minimize methodological biases. Libraries were sequenced on a Genome Sequencer FLX system at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC).\n\nSequence analyses\nReads were inspected using the online tool PRINSEQ v0.20.4 and trimmed with the sfffile tool (454-Roche) according to the quality graphs. After trimming, the two 16S fragments were approximately 320 bp and 470 bp long and fully encompassed V1-V2 and V3-V4, respectively (hereafter named V12 and V34). The six libraries were then similarly processed through QIIME v1.7.0 [46]. Sequences were filtered and demultiplexed using Split_libraries (settings-M3-b10-reverse_primer_mismatches 3-w50-g-s20) followed by denoising with denoise_wrapper.py. Each library was inflated and checked for chimeras using UCHIME v4.2, implemented in Usearch, against the ChimeraSlayer reference database (“gold”) in the Broad Microbiome Utilities. Chimeras were discarded. All same-amplicon sequences were combined and de-novo assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% identity default threshold using uclust [47] and Trie prefilter. A representative sequence for each OTU was picked (i.e. most abundant) and assigned to taxonomy based on the Greengenes database gg_13_5_otus, retraining with the RDP classifier (0.8 confidence level). We retained only OTUs shared across two or more samples, plus all singletons represented by >3 reads. All Cyanobacteria, except members of the new lineage of Melainabacteria (see Results), were removed from the dataset as putatively derived from ingested material. We cannot, however, fully exclude sampling of environmental bacteria, given the inclusion of digesting matter. While this is a common issue when studying wild samples, we also note that the current classification of bacteria as either gut-associated or free-living remains a challenging task and is currently being revised (e.g. for Planctomycetes [48] and Melanobacteria [49]).\nSequences were aligned with PyNAST default parameters [46] using the reference database “core_set_aligned.fasta” from Greengenes website and default lanemask. Alignments were further trimmed and a phylogenetic tree was built with FastTree [50].\nThe three alpha diversity indexes, Chao1, Shannon index, and Phylogenetic diversity (PD) Whole Tree metrics, were estimated on rarefied OTU tables at 500 reads/sample to a sub-sampling depth determined as the minimum number of sequences per sample, and 10 iterations. Beta diversity (Unifrac and binary_Jaccard) was measured using the script jackknifed_beta_diversity.py on an even-depth rarefaction for all samples determined as the minimum number of sequences in each library and visualized through principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). We used the script dissimilarity_mtx_stats.py to calculate means and standard deviations for all the rarefied unweighted unifrac distance matrices. With the script make_distance_boxplots.py we generated distance boxplots for comparisons among all host species and performed two-sample t-tests (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) for all pairs of boxplots to help determine which boxplots (distributions) were significantly different.\nProcrustes analyses were performed to compare beta diversity patterns of UniFrac distances between V12 and V34, with Monte Carlo simulations (1000 permutations).\nRarefaction curves on the observed number of OTUs were calculated on a sub-sampling of 500 reads/sample to a sub-sampling depth determined as the minimum number of sequences in each library and 10 iterations. Graphs were plotted with function ggplot in R.\nThe core microbial taxa and OTUs were computed for each species as well as for all cichlids using an in-house R script. The core was defined as the microbial component shared by ≥80% of the specimens, at least one individual per species and, in case of core taxa (and not OTUs), consistently recovered by both libraries to minimize potential errors in taxonomic assignment of the two 16S fragments.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAlpha diversity estimates were compared among host species through a Mann-Whitney U-test based on average species values obtained by averaging specimen values after rarefaction.\nTo test whether the species relative core length (i.e. percentage of core OTUs shared by at least 80% of conspecifics over the total number of OTUs per fish species) was larger than expected by chance, we applied a permutational test. Observed relative core lengths were compared with those resulting from shuffling species labels and calculating relative core length on five randomly chosen individuals (1000 times).\nMultivariate analyses were used to explore whether microbiota composition at distinct taxonomic levels (OTUs, species, genus, family, order and phylum) was significantly different among fish species, tribes and diet.\nMultivariate data were visualized using PCoA with cmdscale function of stats R package, while differences among groups were tested using distance-based permutational MANOVA with adonis function of vegan R package. First, a PCoA and multivariate test was performed on the entire OTU database using presence-absence data and the Jaccard distance, and these results were compared to PCoAs based on weighted and unweighted unifrac distances. Secondly, analyses were performed on relative abundance data for different taxonomic levels using the Manhattan distance on arcsin transformed relative abundance data. The arcsin transformation is often used to normalize fractional data and gives more weight to both the lowest and highest values. The Manhattan distance is equivalent to the Bray-Curtis distance applied to fractional data, which is widely applied in community ecology.\nThe indicator value of bacterial taxa with respect to fish species, genus or tribe was calculated as per Dufrene and Legendre (1997) as the product of the relative frequency and relative average abundance in clusters (i.e., host species, genus or tribe). In general terms, a bacterial taxon gets a high indicator value if it tends to be present only in one cluster but not in others, and it is shared by most members of that cluster. Indicator values were calculated using function indval of labdsv R package. Concordance between libraries was set as a filter for retaining taxa in order to exclude potential methodological biases.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0127462/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003722","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","abstract":["\nHuman hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic hepatitis and is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV infection alters mitochondrial metabolism. The selective removal of damaged mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis. Here, we report that HBV shifts the balance of mitochondrial dynamics toward fission and mitophagy to attenuate the virus-induced apoptosis. HBV induced perinuclear clustering of mitochondria and triggered mitochondrial translocation of the dynamin-related protein (Drp1) by stimulating its phosphorylation at Ser616, leading to mitochondrial fission. HBV also stimulated the gene expression of Parkin, PINK1, and LC3B and induced Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria. Upon translocation to mitochondria, Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, underwent self-ubiquitination and facilitated the ubiquitination and degradation of its substrate Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a mediator of mitochondrial fusion. In addition to conventional immunofluorescence, a sensitive dual fluorescence reporter expressing mito-mRFP-EGFP fused in-frame to a mitochondrial targeting sequence was employed to observe the completion of the mitophagic process by delivery of the engulfed mitochondria to lysosomes for degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that viral HBx protein plays a central role in promoting aberrant mitochondrial dynamics either when expressed alone or in the context of viral genome. Perturbing mitophagy by silencing Parkin led to enhanced apoptotic signaling, suggesting that HBV-induced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy promote cell survival and possibly viral persistence. Altered mitochondrial dynamics associated with HBV infection may contribute to mitochondrial injury and liver disease pathogenesis.\nAuthor Summary: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infections represent the common cause for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Mitochondrial liver injury has been long recognized as one of the consequences of HBV infection during chronic hepatitis. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo fission, fusion, and selective-autophagic removal (mitophagy), in their pursuit to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and meet cellular energy requirements. The clearance of damaged mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis. We observed that HBV and its encoded HBx protein promoted mitochondrial fragmentation (fission) and mitophagy. HBV/HBx induced the expression and Ser616 phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and its subsequent translocation to the mitochondria, resulting in enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation. HBV also promoted the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, a cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase, and subsequent mitophagy. Perturbation of mitophagy in HBV-infected cells resulted in enhanced mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. This shift of the mitochondrial dynamics towards enhanced fission and mitophagy is essential for the clearance of damaged mitochondria and serves to prevent apoptotic cell death of HBV-infected cells to facilitate persistent infection.

Mechanical tests were performed on fibers and the dynamic and static stresses were measured. A viscoelastic Hill model of 3rd order was used to fit the experimental relaxation test data. In parallel, immunohistochemical analyses were performed on three serial transverse sections to detect the myosin isoforms within the slow and fast muscles.

These two skeletal muscles were chosen based on their known differences in muscle fiber composition (Sol: types I, IIA, IIX and EDL: types IIB, IIX, IIA).\nSoleus and EDL muscles were removed from the right hind limb of five TIEG1−/− and five control (WT: Wild-Type) C57BL/6 female mice, sacrificed at 12 weeks of age by a CO2 exposure and cervical dislocation. Female mice were chosen for analysis in the present report due to previous publications demonstrating significant bone [24] and tendon [13] phenotypes in female animals. Experimental procedures and animal handling were done according to the French animal protection legislation including licensing of experimenters. They were reviewed and approved by the french veterinary services and the ethics commitee, named: Commission française de Génie Génétique (aggreement number #4635). All efforts made to minimize suffering. All muscles (TIEG1−/−: NSol = 5, NEDL = 5; WT: NSol = 5, NEDL = 5) were subjected to a specific preparation to extract fibers with a skinned membrane (sarcolema). Muscles were permeabilized at 4°C in a skinning solution (70 mM potassium propionate, 8 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM EGTA, 7 mM ATP, 6 mM Imidazole, 10 mM PMSF, 50 mg.L-1 Trypsin inhibitor, 4 mg.L-1 Leupeptine, pH = 7.1). Different percentages of glycerol (12.5, 25 and 50%) were then added to the skinning solution [15, 18]. The permeabilized fiber bundles were stored in 50% glycerol skinning solution at -20°C.\n\nPassive mechanical tests\nUnder a binocular microscope (Leica M80), five single muscle fibers were isolated for each TIEG1−/− (NSol = 25, NEDL = 25) and WT (NSol = 25, NEDL = 25) muscle. The fiber was then placed in a small bath (L = 14 mm) filled with a relaxing solution, corresponding to the skinning solution, at a control temperature of 25°C. An aluminum T-clip (Photofabrication, St Neots, UK) was used to connect the extremities of the fiber to a force transducer (5 mN) and to a motor (1400A - 802D Permeabilized Fiber Test Apparatus- Aurora Scientific). An imaging development system (IDS) camera (UI-1220LE, 752 x 480, 0.36 Mpx) allowed for visualization of the fiber architecture composed of successive sarcomeres. The distance between sarcomeres was measured using a Fourier transform algorithm [25].\nImmediately prior to mechanical testing, each fiber was manually stretched to its initial length. This slack length (Ls) was measured using an optical microscope (Leica DM IL LED) at a magnification of 20x. In addition, an average fiber diameter was determined using several measurements along the fiber length. Subsequently, each fiber underwent two preconditioning tests followed by two passive mechanical (ramp stretch, relaxation) tests.\nPreconditioning tests are often performed to insure realignment between all the myofibrils within the fiber, leading to a similar initial configuration across all muscle fibers before loading [16]. Accordingly, each fiber was stretched to 150% Ls at a lengthening rate of 0.005 Ls/s and de-stretched at the same velocity. After a 5 minute rest period at the slack length, this preconditioning test was repeated. The hysteresis loop was plotted for each preconditioning run (Fig 1). The hysteresis area (ΔA) was calculated by subtracting the areas under the extension and de-stretch curves and the data was normalized to the area under the extension curve. The decrease of the hysteresis value (Fig 2) allows for controlling and validating the efficiency of the preconditioning.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164566.g001\nFig 1\n\nRepresentative force-length curve measurement.\nHysteresis ΔA (hatched area) was calculated as the difference between the areas under the extension curve ① (arrow from left to right) and the de-stretch curve ② (arrow from right to left).\n\n\n\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164566.g002\nFig 2\n\nNormalized hysteresis ± SEM values measured after the two preconditioning tests performed on Sol and EDL fibers for each genotype.\nSoleus: Sol, extensor digitorum longus: EDL, WT: wild type, TIEG1-/-: Transforming Growth Factor β inducible early gene-1.\n\n\n\nThe first passive mechanical test that was applied after preconditioning was a ramp stretch. The fibers were stretched to 150% Ls with a velocity of 0.1 Ls/s allowing the measurement of the static force (Fs) at the end of the stretch. The second passive mechanical test performed was a relaxation test. Over a period of 60 s the fiber was repeatedly stretched to 150% Ls at high velocity (10 Ls/s) and released to its slack length. The dynamic force (Fd), corresponding to the maximal force value, and the static force (Fs) measured at the end of the test were recorded.\nAll measured forces were divided by the cross-sectional area of the fiber to obtain dynamic (σd) and static (σs) stresses (Fig 3). Both mechanical tests were repeated two times for each fiber.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0164566.g003\nFig 3\n\nExperimental mechanical behavior of the Sol and EDL fibers, for each genotype, after a ramp stretch.\nThe static stress (σs) was measured at the end of the stretch. Soleus: Sol, extensor digitorum longus: EDL, WT: wild type, TIEG1-/-: Transforming Growth Factor β inducible early gene-1.\n\n\n\n\nModeling the relaxation response\nBased on the relaxation test that was performed at a single velocity (10 Ls/s), a viscoelastic Hill model of 3rd order [21] was used as a first step to fit the experimental viscoelastic data of muscle fiber response in a TIEG1 knockout mouse model system. This model is composed of four branches: three branches include a dashpot of viscosity (ci) in series with a spring of stiffness (ksi) while the fourth branch consists of a spring only that provides time-invariant material stiffness (kp). Stress (σM) at time t can be expressed as a function of stretch amplitude (εr) as follows:\n\n\n\n\nσM(t)=σs+ks1εr e−t/τs1+ks2εr e−t/τs2+ks3εr e−t/τs3\n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere τsi=ciksi are relaxation times.\nDuring the experimental relaxation test, measurements of the static stress (σs) (stress at equilibrium at t = ∞), and the dynamic stress (σd) (stress at time t = 0), were allowed to have the following expressions:\n\n\n\n\nσs=σM(∞)=kpεr\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nσp=σM(0)=σs+ks1εr+ks2εr+ks3εr\n\n\n(3)\n\nSubsequently, a least-squares minimization was applied to fit the model given the experimental stress values (σ(t), σs and σd). Based on the literature [26], three relaxation times were fixed to 0.01 s, 0.1 s and 10 s. The values of the elasticity parameters ks1 and ks2 were optimized in the range [0, (σd − σs) / εr], and the elasticity parameter ks3 was deduced from Eq (3), in order to minimize the cost function:\n\n\n\n\nχ2=∑n=1N[ σ(tn)−σM(tn) ]2\n\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N is the number of time measurements and σ the experimental stress.\nIn order to compare experimental and mathematical fits, the root relative mean square is evaluated as:\n\n\n\n\ne=∑n=1N[σ(tn)−σM(tn)]2∑n=1N[σM(tn)]2\n\n\n(5)\n\nand the quality of fit r2 is defined by:\n\n\n\n\nr2=1−∑n=1N[σ(tn)−σM(tn)]2∑n=1N[σ(tn)−mean(σ(tn))]2\n\n\n(6)\n\nValues of r2 range from -∞ (worst model) to 1 (best model).\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nFollowing the mechanical tests, each fiber was removed and immunohistochemical analysis [27] was performed to identify the fiber type as slow (type I) or fast (type IIB). Specific anti-MyHC antibodies BA-D5, SC-71, and BF-F3 [28] were purchased from DSHB (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Univ of Iowa, USA) to identify the fiber types I, IIA and IIB, respectively. The reactivity of these antibodies have previously been validated on mouse muscle tissues [22]. The fiber types were identified using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B).\nSubsequently, three serial transverse sections (thickness: 10μm) were performed for each muscle using a cryostat (Cryo-star HM 560, Microm International GmbH, Germany) at -20°C. The samples were mounted on a glass slide and stained using an immunohistochemical process. To detect slow and fast MyHC isoforms, a combination of only two anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) antibodies were applied using a semi-automated method [27].\nThe cross-sections were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min to eliminate non-specific binding. They were then incubated with purified primary antibodies in a humidified dark chamber for one hour at 37°C, followed by several washes in PBS and incubation with the secondary antibodies for 30min in a dark room at 37°C [29]. Each section was co-labeled using anti-MyHC and anti-laminin antibodies. For soleus muscle, the MyHC isoforms I and IIA were revealed using BA-D5 and SC-71 primary antibodies, respectively, and an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (A11001, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, dilution 1/200). For EDL muscle, the MyHC isoforms IIA and IIB were depicted using SC-71 and BF-F3, respectively. For the BF-F3 antibody, we used an Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (A11010, Invitrogen; dilution 1/1000). The cell outline was stained using a rabbit anti-laminin primary polyclonal antibody (L9393 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (111-165-008, Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, West Grove, PA, USA, dilution 1/200). The sections were extensively washed in PBS and mounted using Fluoromount (F4680, Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, non-specific reactivity was tested by performing the same immunocytochemistry procedure described above in the absence of primary antibodies (anti-MyHC and anti-laminin).\n\nImage Acquisition and Analysis\nThe histological sections were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX 51) using a magnification of 20x and an appropriate band-pass filter (Alexa 488: excitation filter 460–495, emission filter 510–550, dichromatic mirror 505LP; Cy3: excitation filter 575–625, dichromatic mirror 565LP) as described by Meunier et al. [29]. High-resolution grayscale images were acquired with a camera (Olympus cooled digital camera DP-72) and the Cell-F software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Münster, Germany). Within each serial section, three regions of interest were chosen and two images corresponding to the laminin and MyHCs were digitized. The potential presence of hybrid fibers coexpressing two or more MyHC isoforms was also analyzed. Using a combination of two antibodies within each region of interest, for the Sol and EDL muscles, only two types of fibers could be identified (Sol type I: BA-D5, Sol type IIA: SC-71, EDL type IIA: SC-71, EDL type IIB: BF-F3). The third type (Soltype IIX, EDLtype IIX) corresponds to unstained fibers.\nImage processing and image analysis were performed with the FibTypFluo software program developed in Visual Basic under the Visilog 6.9 Professional Software (Noesis, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). This software automatically calculates the percentage and mean cross sectional area (CSA) of each fiber type.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nThe XLSTAT software package was used to perform all statistical analyses:\n\nNormalized hysteresis values between the two preconditioning tests, for each genotype (TIEG1−/−, WT) and type of fiber (I, IIB), were compared using a paired t test;\nMechanical parameters (σd, σs) between TIEG1−/− and WT, for each muscle (Sol, EDL), were compared using an unpaired t test;\nFiber area and percentage across different fiber types (I, IIA, IIX, IIB) was analyzed with an unpaired t test.\n\nAll data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) with a level of significance set at P < 0.05.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164566/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164566/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164566/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053133/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053133/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053133/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000464","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","abstract":["\nThe brain's decoding of fast sensory streams is currently impossible to emulate, even approximately, with artificial agents. For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of ‘stable heteroclinic channels’. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.\nAuthor Summary: Despite tremendous advances in neuroscience, we cannot yet build machines that recognize the world as effortlessly as we do. One reason might be that there are computational approaches to recognition that have not yet been exploited. Here, we demonstrate that the ability to recognize temporal sequences might play an important part. We show that an artificial decoding device can extract natural speech sounds from sound waves if speech is generated as dynamic and transient sequences of sequences. In principle, this means that artificial recognition can be implemented robustly and online using dynamic systems theory and Bayesian inference.

Mice lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development. However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes λ5 and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly, developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the λ5 gene is impaired in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of genes involved in pre-BCR function.\n"],"title":"Silencing and Nuclear Repositioning of the λ5 Gene Locus at the Pre-B Cell Stage Requires Aiolos and OBF-1","materials_and_methods":["\nMice and cells\nThe Aiolos−/− and OBF-1−/− mice have been described previously [16], [27]. Animal experimentation was carried out according to regulations effective in the Kanton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland as well as in accordance with the FMI internal regulations under supervision of the FMI Animal Committee. The mice were housed in groups of one to six animals at 25°C with a 12∶12 h light-dark cycle. They were fed a standard laboratory diet containing 0.8% phosphorus and 1.1% calcium (NAFAG 890, Kliba, Basel, Switzerland). Food and water was provided ad libitum. All mice were analyzed between 6 and 15 weeks of age. A20J is a murine B cell lymphoma cell. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.\n\nAntibodies and Flow Cytometry\nSingle cell suspensions of purified bone marrow cells or splenocytes were stained with fluorochrome or biotin-labeled antibodies. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems) using a lymphocyte live gate. Cell sorting was carried out on a MoFLOW cell sorter (Dako-Cytomation). Data were analyzed with CellQuest (BD Immunocytometry Systems) and FlowJo (Tree Star) software. For intracellular stainings, cells were fixed for 10 minutes with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin/PBS. At least 1×106 cells were stained with the following antibodies: anti-B220-APC (RA3-6B2); anti-CD25-Biotin or PE (7D4, BD Pharmingen), anti-ckit PE (ACK4, BD Pharmingen), anti-IgM-FITC (1B4B1, Southern Biotech); anti-IgD-Biotin (I-19); anti-pre-BCR-Biotin (SL156); anti-λ5-Biotin (LM34). For secondary stainings the following strepdavidine conjugates were used: strepdavidine-PECy7 (eBiosciences); streptavidine-PECy5.5 (Caltag).\n\nReal time RT-PCR analysis\nBone marrow or splenic cells from 3∼5 age-matched mice were pooled and sorted. RNA was extracted from 4×104 to 1×106 primary cells or cell lines, using TRIzol or the AbsolutelyRNA micro kit (Stratagene). The isolated total RNA was DNaseI-digested to remove genomic contamination and first strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). The real time PCR reactions were carried out in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using the Gold 2×SYBR green reaction mix (Eurogentec). Each assay contained a duplicate and a minus RT control. The efficiency for each real time PCR run was determined according to [28]. The expression of the gene of interest was subsequently normalized to the expression of the housekeeping genes RNA Polymerase II or Ubiquitin C [29]. Normalization of expression data was computed by the qGENE tool [30]. All real time PCR amplicons were set across an exon-exon boundary.

Immunoglobulin κ cDNA was amplified with 30 cycles at 62°C annealing temperature using the following primers:\nVκ deg F: GGCTGCAGSTTCAGTGGCAGTGGRTCWGGRAC;\nCκ R: GTCCTGATCAGTCCAACTGTTCAG;\n\nCell cycle analysis\nBone marrow pre-BI, large and small pre-BII and immature B cells were isolated by cell sorting and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. After permeabilization with 70% ethanol at −20°C the cells were stained with 50 µg/ml Propidium Iodide (Sigma, P 4170) in PBS and treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. The cells were analyzed FACScalibur and the recorded data analyzed with the ModFit software (BD Immunocytometry Systems).\n\nGenomic rearrangement of the κ locus\nB220+ CD25+ IgM− pre-BII cells were isolated from five age-matched animals of each genotype by cell sorting. Genomic DNA was isolated and equal amount of DNA was used in serial dilutions to detect Vκ-Jκ rearrangements. For this, a universal Vκ primer [31] was used in combination with a specific Jκ2 or Jκ5. The Vκ-Jκ DNA was amplified in a multiplex PCR for 35 cycles at 60°C annealing temperature using the specific Vκ1,2 primer together with Jκ1 and Jκ2,3 primers.\nVκ universal F: GGCTGCAGSTTCAGTGGCAGTGGRTCWGGRAC;\nJκ2 R: TTTCCAGCTTGGTCCCCCCTCCGAA;\nJκ5 R: TGCCACGTCAACTGATAATGAGCCCTCTC;\nVκ1,2 F: AGAAGCTTGTGACTCAGGAATCTGCA;\nJκ1 R: CAGGATCCTAGGACAGTCAGTTTGGT;\nJκ2,3 R: CAGGATCCTAGGACAGTGACCTTG;\n\nAffymetrix GeneChip analysis\nPre-BII cells (B220+ CD25+) were isolated from pooled bone marrow of eight age-matched mice from each genotype. From each genotype cells from two independent pools were purified. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted as above and further purified with the RNAeasy mini columns (Qiagen). Starting with 4 mg of total RNA, biotinylated cRNA probes were generated using the SuperScript Choice cDNA sythesis kit from Stratagene and the Affymetrix IVT kit. The labeled cRNA probes were hybridized with the MOE430a Affymetrix GeneChips™ and signals were detected according to manufacturer's instructions. The GeneChips data analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Microarray suite 5 and the GeneSpring 5 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) analysis package. Only target intensities between 100 and 1000 in at least one genotype were used in the analysis. The microarray data has been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) system. The accession number is: GSE12356.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assay\nCrosslinking with formaldehyde and chromatin isolation from A20J B cell line was performed as described [32]. Chromatin was sonicated to an average fragment size from 200 to 600 bp followed by 1∶4-dilution before immunoprecipitation with 5 µg of anti-OBF-1 (Santa Cruz) antibody. As a negative control, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with goat IgG isotype control (Sigma). After crosslinking reversal, the immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real time PCR using the relative standard curve method for normalization.

A probe specific for γ-satellite DNA labeled with dUTP-Cy5 and a BAC clone (RP24–166A3, BAC PAC Resources) for VpreB1/λ5, labeled with dUTP-Cy3 were used [34]. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Leica SP2 AOBS (Acousta Optical Beam Splitter). Optical sections were collected with sections separated by a distance of 0.3 mm. Only cells with two λ5 signals (non-replicating) were evaluated.\n\nRetroviral vectors and infections\nThe expression vector pBabe/puro/Bcl2 was provided by Dr. S. Nutt (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia). The following primers were used for amplification:\nVpreB1 XhoI F: AATTATCTCGAGGTCAGGGCCCAGGAGCAG\nVpreB1 EcoRI R: AATCATGAATTCAGACTAGCCGAGCAAAGCAAACT\nIRES BglII F: CTTGAGATCTGGGATCCGCC\nIRES XhoI R: AATATCCTCGAGATTATCATCGTG\nλ5 clone 2 F: CCTGGGGTTTGGCTACAC\nλ5 clone 2 R: GAGGCTTCAGGGAGGATT\nThe VpreB1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the retroviral vector pMSCV/pgk/EGFP. Subsequently, a 597 bp fragment containing an internal ribosomal entry site was amplified by PCR from the retroviral vector pMSCV/IRES/hCD2t and inserted into the BglII and XhoI sites of pMSCV/VpreB1/pgk/EGFP. Finally, the λ5 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted upstream of the IRES sequence into the HincII site of pMSCV/IRES/VpreB1/pgk/EGFP, leading to pMSCV/λ5/IRES/VpreB1/pgk/EGFP.\nPhoenix-Eco packaging cells were transfected with pBabe/puro/Bcl2, pMSCV/pgk/EGFP, or pMSCV/λ5/IRES/VpreB1/pgk/EGFP retroviral vectors by using calcium phosphate (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Retroviral supernatants from of Phoenix-Eco packaging cells cultured at 37°C were collected after 48 h. Next, the target cells were centrifuged for 90 min at 1800 rpm at room temperature in a retroviral supernatant. Cells were incubated for 90 min at 37°C and submitted to another round of spin infection with fresh retroviral supernatant.\n\nIn vitro maturation of pro/pre-B cells\n5′ Flourouracil treated bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice were transduced and cultured as previously published [35]. In short: 5′ FU treated cells were transduced with pBabe/puro/Bcl2 and selected for Bcl2 expression by puromycin. Subsequently the cells were cultured on OP9 stromal cells with IL-7 and Flt3 to differentiate into pro/pre-B cells. These pro/pre-B cells were transduced with either pMSCV/λ5/IRES/VpreB1/pgk/EGFP or the empty EGFP retroviral expression constructs. The transduced cells were cultured without IL-7 on OP9 stromal cells for 5 or 7 days to induce further B cell maturation. The maturation state of the transduced GFP+ cells was determined by detection of surface κ light chain expression by flow cytometery.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003568/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164565/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\nCold acclimation in woody plants may have special features compared to similar processes in herbaceous plants.

Samples were collected in the months of June (22.8°C average temperature; 15 h, 5 min average day length) and December (4.9°C average temperature; 9 h, 16 min average day length). Controlled-environment experiments were performed using 16–24 week-old chestnut seedlings in growth chambers under the conditions described in Ramos et al. [18]. For the long day (LD) trials, seedlings were grown at 22°C and subjected to a 16 h light/8 h dark (16∶8) photoperiod. Exposure to cold (4°C) was undertaken for a week under the same light regime. Continuous light (LL) experiments were performed on plants that had been grown under conditions of LD and 22°C and thereafter subjected to LL from dawn. Endodormancy experiments were performed as in [18]. Chestnut plants grown in natural conditions enter a state of endodormancy at the end of November. Before satisfying the chilling requirement, plants were transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod and kept for 1 week in these conditions before sample collection. After subjecting the plants to the different treatments, specimens were collected at 3-h intervals. Each experiment was performed at least twice.\n\nIsolation of cDNA Clones\nChestnut CsPRR5, CsPRR7 and CsPRR9 cDNA clones were isolated from a λUni-ZAP XR cDNA library following standard procedures [51]. The library was constructed using chestnut stem poly (A)+ RNA isolated from plants in winter [18]. To detect CsPRR clones other than TOC1, a full length CsTOC1/PRR1 clone was used as probe on two replicate membranes, one under high and the other under low stringency hybridization and washing conditions. After discarding the common spots as TOC1 clones, three different CsPRR clones were detected corresponding to fragments of the genes CsPRR9, CsPRR7 and CsPRR5. To obtain the CsPRR9 full-length cDNA clone, the corresponding fragment was used as probe under high-stringency hybridization and washing conditions. Probes were labeled with [α-32P] dATP using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis). Full-length cDNA clones for CsPRR7 and CsPRR5 were obtained using the “BD SMART RACE cDNA Amplification” kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nNorthern Blot Expression Analysis\nTotal RNA was obtained from chestnut stems and leaves as described in [52], separated on 1.2% agarose gels with 2.2 M formaldehyde [53], and subsequently transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membranes (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). 32P-labeled DNA probes used to detect each specific mRNA were designed to only span the non conserved region of each pseudo response regulator gene.

[18]. Northern blot hybridizations were conducted according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturer. Membranes were washed at high stringency, exposed on storage phosphor screens and visualized in a TYPHOON 9400 phosphorimage scanner (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences Corp.). The rRNA loading reference was estimated by staining gels with ethidium bromide.\n\nReal time RT-PCR Expression Analysis\nTotal RNA was obtained from chestnut stems and leaves as described in [52] with a modification introduced after LiCl precipitation in which the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit columns from Qiagen were used. This kit includes one step to eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA in the total RNA sample. To check the lack of degradation, RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a formamide-formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel. RNA purity and quantity were checked with a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer. For each sample, single stranded cDNA was synthesized from one microgram of total RNA using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). This mix includes oligo (dT)20 and random hexamers. First-strand cDNA was synthesized in a 2720 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) for the non conserved region of each pseudo response regulator gene as follows:\n\nCsPRR5 forward 5′-GCAAAACAAAGAAGAATACTTG-3′ and\n\nCsPRR5 reverse 5′-CTTCACTCCCATGCGTAAG-3′,\n\nCsPRR7 forward 5′-ATTTGTTAAGTGCGTCCCTTG-3′ and\n\nCsPRR7 reverse 5′- TTTCCATATTTGTTCCTGAAGC-3′,\n\nCsPRR9 forward 5′-GAGGTTGTGCCCTTCGGAG-3′ and\n\nCsPRR9 reverse 5′-ACAAGCATTTTCCTTCAATCTC-3′.\n\nCsTOC1 forward 5′-ACTTGATGCTTCTGGCTTACCT-3′ and\n\nCsTOC1 reverse 5′-ATTGTGCTGCTGATGGC-3′\n\nCs18S forward 5′-TCAACTTTCGATGGTAGGATAGTG-3′ and\n\nCs18S reverse 5′-CCGTGTCAGGATTGGGTAATTT-3′\n\nReal time polymerase chain reactions were performed in an optical 384-well plate with an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems), using SYBR Green to monitor dscDNA synthesis [54]. The reaction mixtures contained 1× Power SYBR Green Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems), 250 nM gene-specific primers (except Cs18S, for which 25 nM gene specific-primers were used) and 0.4 µl of the previously synthesized cDNA (except Cs18S for which 0.4 µl of a 25-fold fresh dilution of cDNA was used) in a final volume of 10 µl. The following standard conditions were used in all PCRs: 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 60°C for 1 min. A dissociation step was performed after amplification to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. To estimate variation in the technique, three technical replicates were carried out for each biological replicate. Data were analyzed using SDS 2.2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus cycle number, baseline data and the Rn threshold were detected automatically to obtain Ct (threshold cycle) values. Amplification efficiency for each gene was calculated based on four dilutions of template ranging from 500 ng to 0.5 ng and the equation E = 10−1/slope-1, with slopes in the range slope = −3.3±0.1 and E = 2. mRNA abundances for each candidate gene were calculated as: relative transcript abundance = 2(−ΔΔCt). For the sample chosen as calibrator, ΔΔCt = 0 and therefore the fold-change = 1. Quantified data are shown in the graphs as relative amounts of mRNA. The sample with maximum expression (lower ΔCt) was used as calibrator and 18S ribosomal RNA was used as the reference gene to normalize data. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was checked using Non-Retrotranscriptase controls (RT-) and the absence of environmental contamination using Non-Template Controls (NTC).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003567/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053131/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: In this study we investigated the association between instrumental music training in childhood and outcomes closely related to music training as well as those more distantly related. Methodology/Principal Findings: Children who received at least three years (M = 4.6 years) of instrumental music training outperformed their control counterparts on two outcomes closely related to music (auditory discrimination abilities and fine motor skills) and on two outcomes distantly related to music (vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills). Duration of training also predicted these outcomes. Contrary to previous research, instrumental music training was not associated with heightened spatial skills, phonemic awareness, or mathematical abilities. Conclusions/Significance: While these results are correlational only, the strong predictive effect of training duration suggests that instrumental music training may enhance auditory discrimination, fine motor skills, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning. Alternative explanations for these results are discussed. "],"title":"Practicing a Musical Instrument in Childhood is Associated with Enhanced Verbal Ability and Nonverbal Reasoning","materials_and_methods":["\nParticipants\nFifty-nine children were recruited from public schools and community music schools in the Boston area, as well as by word-of-mouth, to participate in this study which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). All children as well as their parents gave written informed consent to participate in this study. The mean age at the median testing session for each child was 9.96 years (SD = 0.74, range = 8.73 to 11.31 years). Forty-one children (19 boys, 22 girls, mean age = 10.10 years old, SD = 0.76, range = 8.73 to 11.31 years) who had completed a minimum of three years of instrumental music training formed the Instrumental group. The mean number of years training was 4.63 (SD = 1.10; range = 3.16 to 7.07 years). Twenty-two children played keyboard instruments, 12 children played string instruments (10 violin, 2 cello, and 1 double bass), and 6 children played both kinds of instruments (3 studied both piano and violin, 2 studied both piano and viola, and 1 studied both piano and cello). The Instrumental group was subdivided into two subgroups according to the type of instrumental instruction received. Twenty-one children in the Instrumental group received traditional instrumental instruction (in which children are taught to read music notation from the very beginning). The remaining 20 children in the Instrumental group received Suzuki instruction (in which playing by ear is first emphasized, and music notation is only introduced later in the curriculum). Eighteen children (7 girls, 11 boys, mean age = 9.63 years old, SD = 0.57, range = 9.08 to 10.96 years) who had received no instrumental music instruction formed the Control group. Children in both groups were exposed to general music classes in school, typically lasting for 30–40 minutes a week, but these classes included neither instrumental training nor one-on-one music instruction.\n\nMaterials and Procedure\nChildren participated in 3–4 testing sessions (about six hours), over the course of 3–4 weeks.\n\nSocio-Economic Status (SES)\nParents reported their highest level of education on a questionnaire and responses were scored on a 6-point scale: (1) some high school; (2) high school diploma or GED; (3) some college, vocational degree, or associate's degree; (4) 4-year college degree (BA, BS); (5) master's degree (MA, MS, MBA); (6) doctoral degree (PhD, MD, JD, EdD, ThD). Final SES scores represent either the single parent's score in a one-parent family, or the average of both parents' scores in a two-parent family. While education alone is not a complete measure of SES, it is considered to be an acceptable indicator [31].\n\nDuration of Training\nDuration of training for children in the Instrumental group (in weeks) was calculated from the child's first music lesson to the median time-point of the child's testing cycle.\n\nPractice Intensity\nIn addition to reporting the date of commencement of music training, parents also indicated how much their children played their instrument(s) (in minutes per week), including home practice time as well as instruction and ensemble time. We specifically asked parents to estimate practice intensity at the time of testing because we were aware that retrospective estimates might not be accurate.\n\nHandedness\nHandedness was assessed using four measures adapted from Annett [32], [33]. Hand dominance was determined by the use of the same hand for at least three of the four tasks. Those who completed two tasks with one hand and two with the other were classified as mixed-handers. The Control group was composed of only right-handers while the Instrumental group also included four left-handed boys and one left-handed girl.\n\nGordon's Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (IMMA)\nChildren received Gordon's Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (IMMA) [34], which consists of 40 pairs of tone sequences and 40 pairs of rhythms. Children make a same/different judgment by circling a pair of same or different faces on the answer sheet.\n\nMelodic and Rhythmic Discrimination task\nA Melodic/Rhythmic Discrimination task designed in our lab [33], [35] was also administered. Children indicated whether two melodic or rhythmic phrases of 5 tones each were the same or different. In contrast to the sine-wave tones used in Gordon's IMMA, our own stimuli used the sound of an actual musical instrument (marimba) so that both attack and release could be discerned. Unlike the Gordon's stimuli, which varied in overall length, our stimuli were identical in overall duration. This served to clarify the metric context so that children could focus on melodic or rhythmic differences.\n\nMotor Learning task\nBeginning with their non-dominant hand, children performed three, 30-second trials of a 4-finger sequence task on the number keys of an alpha-numeric computer keyboard [33]. In order to avoid potential confusion for musicians who associate numbers with specific fingers, colored stickers were placed over the numbers on the four target keys, and a matching set of stickers was placed on the child's fingers to correspond with the pattern. Each target pattern was represented by a series of colored stickers on a card that served as a visual reminder during the task. Children were asked to repeat the correct sequence of key presses as many times as possible in 30 seconds. The task was performed three times with each hand, with a 30-second rest period between trials. Full credit (a score of 1) was given for each correct, 5-key press sequence; partial credit was given for sequences with four consecutive key presses (score of 0.8) and three consecutive key presses (score of 0.6). Scores from the three trials were averaged to obtain a mean score for each hand.\n\nBlock Design\nChildren received the Block Design subtest of the WISC-III [36] (age-scaled). Rauscher, Shaw, Levine, Wright, Dennis, et al. [37] argued that this is a spatial recognition task since the physical model (picture) of the design to be copied remains present during the task. It therefore does not require the formation of a mental image. Schellenberg [29] showed that performance on this task (as well as on all but one of the other WISC subtests) improved after music training.\n\nObject Assembly\nChildren received the Object Assembly subtest of the WISC-III [36] (age-scaled). This task requires both the formation of a mental image and the manipulation of that image within a limited time period [37]. Performance on this task has been shown to be improved by music training [29], [37].\n\nRaven's Progressive Matrices\nThree levels of the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) were administered in the following order: Colored Progressive Matrices, Standard Progressive Matrices and Advanced Progressive Matrices-Set I [38]–[40]. The RPM is considered to be a nonverbal reasoning task with visual-spatial elements [13]. Alternatively, one can think of this task as a visual pattern completion task. As mentioned earlier, a meta-analysis by Hetland [13] demonstrated that performance on Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices was not improved after music training.\n\nVocabulary\nChildren were given the Vocabulary subtest of the WISC-III [36] (age-scaled), which consists of up to 30 words to be defined orally.\n\nAuditory Analysis Test\nChildren received the Auditory Analysis Test [41], a measure of phonemic awareness. Children hear a list of 40 spoken words (e.g., smell) and are asked to repeat the word and then say it again without one of its sounds (e.g., Say “smell”; now say it again, but without the “m”).\n\nKeyMath–Revised\nChildren received Keymath-Revised: A Diagnostic Inventory of Essential Mathematics [42], which is a comprehensive assessment of children's understanding and application of mathematical concepts and skills. This test is divided into three concept areas (age-scaled): 1) Basic Concepts-assesses foundation knowledge (numeration, rational numbers and geometry); 2) Operations-assesses computational skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and mental computation-which covers all four operations); and 3) Applications-assesses the ability to apply mathematical knowledge and skills (measurement, time and money, estimation, data interpretation, and problem solving). Because this test was introduced in our battery later, only about two thirds of our sample are included in the math analyses.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003720/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003566/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139830","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nThe Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in the tumorigenesis of multiple cancers and is a key target for drug discovery. In a screen of natural products extracted from Chinese herbs, we identified eight ent-Kaurane diterpenoids and two triterpene dilactones as novel Hh pathway antagonists. Epistatic analyses suggest that these compounds likely act at the level or downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and upstream of Suppressor of Fused (Sufu). The ent-Kauranoid-treated cells showed elongated cilia, suppressed Smo trafficking to cilia, and mitotic defects, while the triterpene dilactones had no effect on the cilia and ciliary Smo. These ent-Kaurane diterpenoids provide new prototypes of Hh inhibitors, and are valuable probes for deciphering the mechanisms of Smo ciliary transport and ciliogenesis.\n"],"title":"A Group of ent-Kaurane Diterpenoids Inhibit Hedgehog Signaling and Induce Cilia Elongation","materials_and_methods":["\nCell culture\nNIH 3T3 (ATCC, CRL-1658TM), Shh light II (ATCC, CRL-2795TM) [14], HEK 293 (ATCC, CRL-1573TM), HEK 293W [15] and Sufu-/- MEFs [16] cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. Fibroblast-derived cells were prevented from becoming too confluence before propagation to maintain the property of contact inhibition. Shh light II cells were derived from NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the following dual luciferase reporters: (1) Gli-responsive firefly luciferase and (2) thymidine kinase-derived Renilla luciferase [14]. HEK 293W cells were derived from HEK 293 cells stably transfected with Wnt3a and the following dual luciferase reporters: (1) Wnt responsive SuperTOPflash firefly luciferase and (2) simian virus 40-Renilla luciferase [15]. The Sufu-/- MEFs were originally derived from Dr. Rune Toftgård’s lab [16] and were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Y. Cheng [17] with the permission of Dr. Rune Toftgård.\n\nReagents\nSAG, cytochalasin D, 5Z-7-Oxoeaneol, GANT58, EGCG and MG132 were purchased from Sigma, vismodegib from Selleck Chemicals, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) from Cayman Chemicals, Bodipy-Cyclopamine from Toronto Research Chemicals, and vinblastine and AZ-TAK1 from Santa Cruz Biotech.\n\nIsolation of Natural Products\nKamebakaurin, kamebakaurinin [18], phyllostachysin H [19], calcicolin A [20], tenuifolin A, tenuifolin I [21], adenanthin C and adenanthin G [22] were isolated from the genus Isodon as described. Longipedlactone L [23] was isolated from Kadsura ananosma and longipedlactone H [24] from Kadsura longipedunculata as described. The plants were collected in Yunnan, China; no permission was required.\n\nHh Pathway Dual Reporter Assay\nShh light II cells were propagated on white 96-well assay plates (Corning) and grown to extreme confluence. Then the medium was changed to 0.5% FBS/DMEM medium with various compounds for 30 hr. The cells were lysed and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Bright-Glo reagents (Promega) on a Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Fisher). All of the samples were conducted in triplicate. The Gli-firefly/Renilla luciferase ratio represented the Hh pathway activity. For Wnt reporter analysis, HEK 293W cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 60% confluence, treated with the compounds for 1 day, and then lysed to measure the reporter activities.\n\nBodipy-Cyclopamine Competition Binding Assay\nBodipy-Cyclopamine competition binding assays were conducted as previously described [13] with modifications. HEK 293 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and transfected with Smo-mCherry using Fugene HD (Roche) at 70% confluence. After 2 days of Smo expression, the cells were incubated with 10 nM Bodipy-Cyc and 10 or 20 μM of various HPAs for 1 hour (100 nM of SAG was used as a positive control). Then, the cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize the nuclei. All of the images were captured under the same exposure conditions using a 10x objective with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. At least five images were taken from each sample with similar Smo-mCherry expression levels. Fluorescence intensities of each image were quantitatively measured using ImageJ (NIH).\n\nReal-time PCR Analysis of Hh Target Gene Expression\nNIH 3T3 cells and Sufu-/- MEFs were grown to confluency and their medium were changed to 0.5% FBS medium diluted with various HPAs for 30 hr. Total RNA was extracted and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the standard protocol. Next, 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was reversely transcribed to cDNA with random hexamer primer (Fermentas). The mRNA levels of mouse Gli1, Ptch1and Gapdh were quantified using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) on a LightCycler 480 system (Roche). The following primers were used: (1) Gli1, 5’- CCAAGCCAACTTTATGTCAGGG–3’ and 5’- AGCCCGCTTCTTTGTTAATTTGA–3’; (2) Ptch1, 5’- CGAGACAAGCCCATCGACATTA–3’ and 5’- AGGGTCGTTGCTGACCCAAG–3’; and (3) Gapdh, 5’- TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA–3’ and 5’- TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG–3’.\n\nCilia and Ciliary Smo Analysis\nFor de novo ciliogenesis and ciliary Smo analysis, NIH 3T3 cells were grown to confluence, and then their medium was changed to serum starvation medium (0.5% FBS/DMEM) with various compounds for 30 hr. To analyze the effects of ent-Kauranoids on mature cilia, the confluent cells were first incubated in serum starvation medium for 1 day to fully induce cilia formation before the compounds were added for an additional 30 hr. Cilia and Smo immunostaining was performed according to previously reported procedures [25]. The following antibodies were used for the immunostaining: rabbit polyclonal anti-Arl13b (17711-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse monoclonal anti-Smo (sc–166685, Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin (T7451, Sigma), and donkey AlexaFluor 488 or 594 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen).\nImages were acquired with identical setting parameters, using 6-plane Z-stacks (1 μm step size) to encompass all of the cilia and Smo in the field with a 100X oil immersion objective on an Olympus FV1000 laser confocal microscope. Images of the Z-stacks were summed as final micrographs for quantitative assessment with the method of maximal intensity projections using Image-Pro Plus 6 (Media Cybernetics). To measure the length of the cilia, images were calibrated with scale ruler, the cilia contour were outlined using the segmented line tool, and the lengths of cilia were measured with ImageJ. To quantitatively analyze the ciliary Smo, the cilia were manually outlined with a mask in the Arl13b channel and the Smo fluorescence intensities were then measured in the Smo image channel. The total signal for a single cilium was taken as one data point. Approximately 100 cilia and ciliary Smo were measured from ten images for each group.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nCalculation of the mean, SD and IC50 with the Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA analysis were performed with GraphPad Prism 6.\n\nMitotic Spindle Assembly Assay\nMitotic spindle assembly assay was performed as previously reported [25]. Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were enriched at metaphase with 15 μM MG132 for 90 min, followed by a 60 min incubation with 15 μM MG132, and 50 or 25 μM kamebakaurin. Cells were fixed by methanol for 10 min at -20°C, and immunostained with mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (T9026, Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-pericentrin (ab4448, Abcam) antibodies. Approximately 100 metaphase spindles were scored.\n\nTubulin and Actin Polymerization Assays\nThe effect of kamebakaurin on tubulin and actin polymerization was performed using a Tubulin Polymerization Assay Kit (BK011P, Cytoskeleton) and an Actin Polymerization Biochem Kit (BK003, Cytoskeleton), respectively, with the manufacturer’s guidance.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139830/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139830/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139830/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139830/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/references","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/body","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/introduction","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000463/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Background: The SH2-containing-5′inositol phosphatase-1 (SHIP) influences signals downstream of cytokine/chemokine receptors that play a role in megakaryocytopoiesis, including thrombopoietin, stromal-cell-derived-Factor-1/CXCL-12 and interleukin-3. We hypothesize that SHIP might control megakaryocytopoiesis through effects on proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitors (MKP) and megakaryocytes (MK). Methodology and Principal Findings: Herein, we report the megakaryocytic phenotype and MK functional assays of hematopoietic organs of two strains of SHIP deficient mice with deletion of the SHIP promoter/first exon or the inositol phosphatase domain. Both SHIP deficient strains exhibit a profound increase in MKP numbers in bone marrow (BM), spleen and blood as analyzed by flow cytometry (Lin−c-Kit+CD41+) and functional assays (CFU-MK). SHIP deficient MKP display increased phosphorylation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT-3), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Despite increased MKP content, total body number of mature MK (Lin−c-kit−CD41+) are not significantly changed as SHIP deficient BM contains reduced MK while spleen MK numbers are increased. Reduction of CXCR-4 expression in SHIP deficient MK may influence MK localization to the spleen instead of the BM. Endomitosis, process involved in MK maturation, was preserved in SHIP deficient MK. Circulating platelets and red blood cells are also reduced in SHIP deficient mice.

"],"title":"SH2-Inositol Phosphatase 1 Negatively Influences Early Megakaryocyte Progenitors","materials_and_methods":["\nMice strains\nSHIP−/− mice (F9 or F10×C57BL6/J) produced in our laboratory have a deletion of the SHIP promoter and first exon [7]. A second SHIP deficient mouse model was also analyzed, SHIPΔIP/ΔIP (129SvJ) [36], in which the inositol phosphatase domain is deleted (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch, Rockefeller University, NY, USA). All studies described herein were conducted on six to eight week-old adult mice. Experiments were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines of the University of South Florida.\n\nCell isolation\nIsolation of BM cells and splenocytes was as described previously [8]. Following red blood cell (RBC) lysis, the cells were resuspended in staining media [8]. PB was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus, sub-mandibular, or heart. For MKP analysis of PB, RBC were lysed twice in 1× RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience). Cells were then resuspended for antibody staining.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis and antibodies\nStaining of MKP and MK was performed as per Hodohara et al [34]. All antibodies were from BD Biosciences except when mentioned. The cells were treated with anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) to block Fc receptors and then stained with a Lin panel-PE, CD41-FITC (MWReg30), and c-Kit-APC (2B8). The Lin- panel was CD3ε (17A2), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8α (53-6.7), B220 (RA3-6B2), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), Mac-1 (M1/70) (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) and Ter119 (TER-119). Dead cells were excluded using 7-AAD (BD Biosciences). Data was acquired on a FACS Calibur using the FACS Quest software and analysis was done using FlowJo 4.5. For the CXCR-4 analysis, the antibodies mentioned above were used to define the MKP population. CXCR-4 antibody (2B11/CXCR-4) conjugated to biotin was added to the stain, which was revealed using a streptavidin-PeCy7 antibody. For this stain, dead cells were excluded using DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) and data was acquired on a FACS LSR (BD Dickenson).\n\nPlatelet analysis\nBlood was collected by heart puncture using a 25 gauge needle with an EDTA coated 1 ml syringe, or by sub-mandibular bleed. For each method the blood was collected directly into microtainer K2EDTA tubes (BD, Franklin, NJ, USA). 200 µl of blood (either diluted 1∶4 or whole blood) was then analyzed on the CellDyn 3700 hematology analyzer using the Veterinary Package Software (Abbott Diagnostic, Dallas, Texas USA), with a ratio to default corresponding to the mice strain studied.\n\nHistopathology\nBone and spleen were fixed in 10% buffered paraformaldehyde. Bones were first decalcified using Routine Acid Decalcification (RDO; Apex engineering Products, Plainfield, IL, USA), followed by sectioning. The spleen and bone sections were then stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin after being deparaffinized with xylene or stained with Glycoprotein IIB-IIIA (CD41) antibody. Briefly, slides were stained using the modified Meyer's Hematoxylin and Eosin phloxine B solution (Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA, USA) according to a modified Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) protocol. Cells were visualized on a Leica DM LB microscope. Pictures were taken using a RTcolor Spot camera (Diagnostic Instrument Inc) with Spot Advance v3.0 software.\n\nPloidy assay\nBM cells were isolated from hind/fore limb and vertebral column. Briefly, cells were incubated on ice with CD41-biotin antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) and then with anti-biotin beads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4°C. CD41+ cells were then selected using the autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). Collected CD41+ cells were stained with Lin panel-FITC as mentioned above and with streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences). The cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes on ice and then incubated overnight in a 70% ethanol solution at −20°C. The day after, the cells were washed carefully of any residual ethanol with PBS and incubated for at least 3 hours in a propidium iodine (PI) solution composed of 50 µg/ml PI, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 U/ml RNase in PBS without Ca or MG (all from Sigma-Aldrich except for the PBS which was from Gibco BRL/Invitrogen).\n\nCFU-MK assay\nHundred thousand 105 whole BM cells were assessed for megakaryocyte progenitor activity in a CFU-Mk assay, MegaCult-C (Stem cell Technologies, Vancouver, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nPhosphorylation analysis of signaling proteins\nPhospho-flow analysis was performed on BM cells isolated from 129SvJ WT and SHIPΔIP/ΔIP. Cells were isolated on ice, after red blood cell lysis, cells were stained for Lin−c-kit+CD41+ using the same antibody clones than mentioned above, except for c-kit which was conjugated to PeCy7 instead of APC. Cells were then directly fixed with Fix buffer (BD Biosciences) for 10 minutes at 37°C and washed with Perm/Wash buffer I (BD Biosciences). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in Perm/Wash buffer I. The appropriate phospho-antibody was added to the cells, and incubated at RT for 30 minutes. The cells were then washed twice in Perm/wash buffer I and stored in that same buffer on ice until the time of acquisition The phospho-antibodies were from BD Biosciences, anti-phospho-Stat3Y705 (clone 4/P-Stat3), anti-phospho ERK1/2 T202/T204 (clone 20a), anti phosphor Akt S473) (clone F29-763). The analysis was carried on a BD LSR II (BD Biosciences).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis for each experiment consisted of the Mann-Whitney test performed using the Prism software. For each experiment, the number of individual mice analyzed is indicated as “n” in the figure legends. All mice were analyzed individually (i.e. the cells from different animals were not pooled together for these experiments).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003565/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/conclusions","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["Aim: Iron deficiency is a common comorbidity in chronic heart failure (CHF) which may exacerbate CHF. The c-kit+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) play a vital role in cardiac function repair. However, much is unknown regarding the role of iron deficiency in regulating c-kit+ CSCs function. In this study, we investigated whether iron deficiency regulates c-kit+ CSCs proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation in vitro. Method: All c-kit+ CSCs were isolated from adult C57BL/6 mice. The c-kit+ CSCs were cultured with deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator), mimosine (MIM, another iron chelator), or a complex of DFO and iron (Fe(III)), respectively. Cell migration was assayed using a 48-well chamber system. Proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of c-kit+ CSCs were analyzed with BrdU labeling, population doubling time assay, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry. Caspase-3 protein level and activity were examined with Western blotting and spectrophotometric detection. The changes in the expression of cardiac-specific proteins (GATA-4,TNI, and β-MHC) and cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin D1, RB, and pRB) were detected with Western blotting. Result: DFO and MIM suppressed c-kit+ CSCs proliferation and differentiation. They also modulated cell cycle and cardiac-specific protein expression. Iron chelators down-regulated the expression and phosphorylation of cell cycle-related proteins. Iron reversed those suppressive effects of DFO. DFO and MIM didn’t affect c-kit+ CSCs migration and apoptosis. Conclusion: Iron deficiency suppressed proliferation and differentiation of c-kit+ CSCs. This may partly explain how iron deficiency affects CHF prognosis. "],"title":"Effect of Iron Deficiency on c-kit+ Cardiac Stem Cells In Vitro","materials_and_methods":["All experimental protocols involving cells or procedures with mice were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.\nIsolation of c-kit+ CSCs\nAll c-kit+ CSCs were isolated as a previous report with minor modifications [11]. Briefly, hearts were removed under aseptic conditions from adult C57BL/6 mice. The myocardial tissue was cut into 1 to 2 mm3 pieces, washed twice with Ca2+–Mg2+–free phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and digested four times for 10 min with 0.05% collagenase II (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) alternately at 37°C with frequent shaking. After the enzymatic digestion, a cell suspension was collected and filtered with a strainer. The obtained cells were incubated with lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi biotec, Germany) and separated by biotin-antibody cocktail immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi biotec, Germany). The negative lineage cells were collected and incubated with anti-mouse-c-kit microbeads (Miltenyi biotec, Germany) and separated. Those c-kit positive small round cells were collected.\n\nImmunostaining\nImmunostaining was performed by incubation with specific primary antibody: rabbit anti-c-kit (diluted 1∶100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 4°C overnight. Cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated rat anti-rabbit Ig G (diluted 1∶250) at 25°C for 2 h. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma, USA).The immunoreactions were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Japan).\n\nCell Culture and Flow Cytometric Analysis\nThe obtained c-kit+ CSCs were cultured with DMEM (Thermo, USA) containing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 ng/ml bFGF, and 10 ng/ml LIF at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for three days. After recovery, the cells were used for flow cytometric analysis and subsequent experiments.\nThen, the expression of cell surface marker of the collected cells was analyzed. The collected cells were made into single cells suspensions and stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies against c-kit, CD34, CD45 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), or IgG isotype control (Cell signaling, Massachusetts, USA). The positive rate of c-kit, CD34, CD45, or isotype control in the total cells was detected with flow cytometry.\n\nQuantification of Intracellular Iron Content\nCells were treated with DFO (Sigma, USA) (0, 50, 100, 200 µM), MIM (Sigma, USA) (0.5 mM), or a complex of DFO (100 µM) and Fe(III) (0.5 mM). Intracellular iron content was determined by the colorimetric ferrozine-based assay as previously described [12]. Absorbance of each sample was measured at 562 nm using the Spectra Max microplate reader.\n\nCell Proliferation and BrdU Incorporation Analysis\nIsolated c-kit+ CSCs were seeded on 96-well plates (5×103 cells per well), and cultured in 100 µl 10% FCS DMEM medium for 12 h. Cells were treated with different concentrations of DFO (0, 50, 100, 200 µM) or MIM (0.5 mM) for different time (24, 48, 72 h). The cellular level was measured with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan) and a Microplate Reader (450 nm). For BrdU (Sigma) incorporation analysis,cells were treated with DFO (100 µM) for 48 h. After labeling with BrdU for the final 18 h of the incubation period, DNA was denatured and cells were incubated with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody for detecting incorporated BrdU. The absorbance related to the BrdU level was measured with a microplate reader at 450 nm. Then, the proliferation index for each group was calculated in relation to the corresponding control taken to be 100%.\n\nPopulation Doubling Time\nA total of 2×105 cells/ml of c-Kit+ CSCs at passage 3 was cultivated for a period of 3 days (24, 48 and 72 h). Cells were treated with DFO (100 µM), MIM (0.5 mM), or a complex of DFO (100 µM) and Fe(III) (0.5 mM). Cell numbers were determined every 24 h using a Neubauer improved haematocytometer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Cell numbers were counted in triplicate. Population doubling time was calculated using online algorithm software provided at http://www.doubling-time.com.\n\nCell Cycle Analysis\nFlow cytometry analysis of cell cycle was performed as a previous report [13]. Briefly, c-Kit+ CSCs were treated with/without DFO, MIM, or a complex of DFO and Fe(III). After treatment, cells were harvested, trypsinized, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at −20°C. Cells were washed with PBS, treated with RNase for 30 min, followed by staining with propidium iodide. The DNA content was analyzed with FACSCalibur and CellQuest Pro software. Results were obtained from 5 independent experiments.\n\nCell Migration Assay\nThe c-Kit+ CSCs were pre-incubated with DFO (100 µM), MIM (0.5 mM), or a complex of DFO (100 µM) and Fe(III) (0.5 mM) for 24 h before seeding. Then, 1×104 c-Kit+ CSCs in 100 µl of medium were seeded into the upper chamber (pore size, 8 µm). DMEM plus 10% FCS was put into the lower chamber of a 24-well transwell. The chamber was incubated for 12 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 before the filter and the un-migrated cells were removed. After fixation and staining, the number of migrated cells on the lower surface of the filter was counted under a microscope. Experiments were repeated 5 times.\n\nCell Apoptosis Assay\nThe c-Kit+ CSCs were stimulated with DFO (100 µM), MIM (0.5 mM), H2O2 (0.5 mM), or a complex of DFO (100 µM) and Fe(III) (0.5 mM) for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptosis of c-Kit+ CSCs were then analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI staining (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA). Cells were harvested and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before they were re-suspended in 1X Binding Buffer at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml. Then, 100 µl of cell suspension were treated with 5 µl of FITC Annexin V and 1 µl 100 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI). The cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature (25°C), and 400 µl of 1X Binding Buffer was added to each tube. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometer as soon as possible.\n\nQuantification of Caspase-3 Activity\nThe activity of caspase-3 was assessed using Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kits (Beyotime, China). In brief, cells were incubated with DFO (100 µM), MIM (0.5 mM), H2O2 (0.5mM), or a complex of DFO (100 µM) and Fe(III) (0.5 mM), for 24 h or 48 h. The cells were then washed in PBS and suspended in 100 ml lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 200 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12, 000 g at 4°C for 20 min and then collected. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Supernatant samples containing 50 mg of total proteins were used for determination of caspase-3 activity. These samples were added to each well in 96-well microtiter plates with the DEVD-pNA at 37°C for 2 h. The optical density of each well was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader.\n\nCell Differentiation Assay\nThe c-Kit+ CSCs were plated on 6-well plates. Cell differentiation was induced by differentiation medium (DMEM, 10% FCS and 10−8 M dexamethasone) with/without DFO, MIM, or a complex of DFO and Fe(III) for 2 weeks. After the induction of differentiation, total proteins were extracted. The ability of differentiation was determined by analyzing the cellular morphology and the expression of cardiac-specific markers (TNI, β-MHC, and GATA-4).\n\nPreparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts\nCells were rinsed in cold PBS and lysed in a solution containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA (all products from Sigma Aldrich), and Complete™ Mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). After centrifugation (30 sec, 2,000×g), supernatants were incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation (4°C, 3 min, 15,000×g), supernatants collected as cytosolic extracts, and the nuclei re-suspended in a solution of 10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and Complete Mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000×g, and saved as nuclear extracts.\n\nWestern Blotting Analysis\nProtein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein Assay. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel. Then, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After being blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk in tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, proteins were incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-c-kit antibody, anti-β-MHC antibody, anti-TNI antibody, anti-GATA-4 antibody, anti-caspase-3 antibody, anti-β-actin antibody, anti-RB antibody, anti-pRB antibody, anti-cyclin D1 antibody, 1∶1000 dilution, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc USA) and secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG 1∶5000 dilution; Li-cor, USA), the protein bands were detected with the infrared Odyssey imaging System (Li-Cor, USA).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nValues are displayed as mean plus or minus SEM. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by the Student’s t test (two-tailed). Results were considered statistically significant for P values less than 0.05.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0065721/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003718","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","abstract":["\nHuman adenovirus serotypes Ad3, Ad7, Ad11, and Ad14 use the epithelial junction protein desmoglein 2 (DSG2) as a receptor for infection. During Ad infection, the fiber and penton base capsid proteins are produced in vast excess and form hetero-oligomers, called pentons. It has been shown for Ad3 that pentons self-assemble into penton-dodecahedra (PtDd). Our previous studies with recombinant purified Ad3 PtDd (produced in insect cells) showed that PtDd bind to DSG2 and trigger intracellular signaling resulting in the transient opening of junctions between epithelial cells. So far, a definitive proof for a function of Ad3 PtDd in the viral life cycle is elusive. Based on the recently published 3D structure of recombinant Ad3 PtDd, we generated a penton base mutant Ad3 vector (mu-Ad3GFP). mu-Ad3GFP is identical to its wild-type counterpart (wt-Ad3GFP) in the efficiency of progeny virus production; however, it is disabled in the production of PtDd. For infection studies we used polarized epithelial cancer cells or cell spheroids. We showed that in wt-Ad3GFP infected cultures, PtDd were released from cells before viral cytolysis and triggered the restructuring of epithelial junctions. This in turn facilitated lateral viral spread of de novo produced virions. These events were nearly absent in mu-Ad3GFP infected cultures. Our in vitro findings were consolidated in mice carrying xenograft tumors derived from human epithelial cancer cells. Furthermore, we provide first evidence that PtDd are also formed by another DSG2-interacting Ad serotype, the newly emerged, highly pathogenic Ad14 strain (Ad14p1). The central finding of this study is that a subgroup of Ads has evolved to generate PtDd as a strategy to achieve penetration into and dissemination in epithelial tissues. Our findings are relevant for basic and applied virology, specifically for cancer virotherapy.\nAuthor Summary: We have recently reported that a group of human Ads uses DSG2 as a receptor for infection. Among the DSG2-interacting Ads is serotype 3, which is widely distributed in the human population. During Ad3 infection, subviral particles (PtDd) formed by two capsid proteins are produced in vast excess and released early in infection. In this study, we demonstrate that PtDd trigger the opening of epithelial junctions and thus support the lateral spread of Ad3 progeny virus in epithelial tissues. Our study contributes to a better understanding of Ad3 infection and pathology. It also has implications for Ad-mediated gene transfer into epithelial tissues and tumors.

AF648, R&D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN), mouse mAb anti-DSG2 (clone 6D8) (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA), anti-fiber primary antibody (Clone 4D2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA), polyclonal goat anti-Ad2 (cat. 1401, Virostat, Maine, USA), monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), FITC conjugated goat anti-adenovirus (Millipore Billerica, MA), and PE conjugated rabbit anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit-AF488, anti-rabbit-AF568, anti-mouse-AF488, anti-mouse- AF568, anti-goat-AF568 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against purified recombinant Ad3 knob were produced by PickCell Laboratories B.V. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The polyclonal rabbit antibody against purified recombinant Ad3 PtDd was described earlier [7]. Rhodamine labeled Concanavalin A (cat. RL-1002) and vectorshield mounting medium with DAPI (cat. H-1200) were purchased from vector laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA).\n\nCell lines\n293 (Microbix, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), HeLa and A549 (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmol/liter L-glutamine (Glu), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (pen-strep). Colon cancer T84 cells (ATCC CCL-248) were cultured in a 1∶1 mixture of Ham's F12 medium and DMEM, 10% FBS, Glu, and pen-strep. To achieve cell polarization, 2×105 T84 cells were cultured in 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (0.4 µm pore size) (Costar Transwell Clears) for more than 14 days until transepithelial resistance was stable. Culture medium was changed every 2–3 days.\n\nTumor spheroids\nExponentially growing T84 cells (3×107 cells) in 150 ml fresh culture medium were transferred to a 250-ml spinner bottle (INTEGRA Biosciences, Zizers, Switzerland) and cultured in the incubator for 4 days at a stirring speed of 75 rpm. The formed spheroids were aspirated into a 15-ml tube and the medium was removed after spinning at 500 rpm for 5 min. The precipitated T84 spheroids were loosened by gentle flip and infected with viruses for 2 hours at room temperature. Unattached viruses were removed by washing, and the spheroids were resuspended in 5 ml fresh medium and cultured in the original 15-ml tube in a cell incubator. The tube was gently flipped twice every day to prevent coagulation of the spheroids. After 2–4 days' culture, spheroids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hour, washed twice with PBS, incubated with Rhodamine labeled Concanavalin A (1∶200 diluted) for 30 min at room temperature, washed another two times with PBS, transferred to a slide, mixed with vectorshield mounting medium containing DAPI, covered with a cover slip, and observed under a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope.\n\nAdenoviruses\nPropagation and purification of Ads were performed as described elsewhere [28]. Wild-type Ad5 was rescued from pFG140 plasmid transfected 293 cells (Microbix, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Ad14p1 (strain Portland 2971/2007) was provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) [21]. wt-Ad3GFP is a wild-type Ad3-based vector containing a CMV-GFP expression cassette inserted into the E3 region [2]. Penton base-mutated Ad3-GFP (mu-Ad3GFP) was constructed as following: wt-Ad3GFP plasmid (pWEA-Ad3GFP) was digested with AscI, and the short fragment (7772 bp) was ligated to an AscI-digested kanamycin resistant gene-pBR322 origin containing fragment, which was amplified from pShuttle-CMV plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers 1210KAscI01 and 1210KAscI02, to generate pKPenton3AscI (see Table 1). To introduce D100R mutation to pKPenton3AscI, PCR was performed with primers 1210PentonM01 and 1210PentonM02 using pKPenton3AscI as the template. PCR product (1233 bp) was excised with BamHI and NheI, and inserted into the corresponding sites of pKPenton3AscI to generate pKPenton3R. Similarly, PCR was conducted using pKPenton3AscI as the template with primers 1210PentonM03 and 04, and with primers 1210PentonM05 and 06. The two PCR products (344 and 1247 bp) were united using overlap extension PCR with primers 1210PentonM03 and 1210PentonM06. The recovered fragment (1545 bp) were digested with XbaI and XmaI, and substituted for the XbaI-XmaI region in pKPenton3R to generate pKPenton3RE. The D100R and R425E mutations in pKPenton3RE were confirmed by sequencing. pKPenton3RE was further digested with AscI, and penton-mutated fragment was inserted back to pWEA-Ad3GFP to generate a new adenovirus plasmid pWEA-mu-Ad3GFP. pWEA-mu-Ad3GFP was linearized with FseI, and then used to transfect 293 cells. The rescued viruses were propagated in HeLa cells and purified by standard methods. We have sequenced the genome of both viruses and did not find additional mutations. Whole genome sequencing was performed by Eurofins MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL).\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1003718.t001Table 1\nPCR primers for mu-Ad3GFP plasmid construction.\n\n\n\n\nName\nsequence\nLength of product (bp)\nrestriction enzyme site\n\n\n\n\n1210KAscI01\nccggggcgcg cccgatcccg agcggtatca gctc\n2492\nAscI\n\n\n1210KAscI02\nccggggcgcg ccaaactgga acaacactca accctatc\n\nAscI\n\n\n1210PentonM01\nccgctgagga ggagcggatc ctcagatacg\n1233\nBamHI\n\n\n1210PentonM02\ngggtgctagc ctccgtgggg gtaaacctat tgttctgcac caccgtg\n\nNheI\n\n\n1210PentonM03\ncagaggaaac tagtgaagat gatgatataa c\n344\nSpeI\n\n\n1210PentonM04\ngttgttgact tgtcttgtgg actcgaaggt gactgggtct tgcatc\n\n\n\n\n1210PentonM05\ngatgcaagac ccagtcacct tcgagtccac aagacaagtc aacaac\n1247\n\n\n\n1210PentonM06\ngtggtcccgg gtctgagcac ttgacgcact t\n\nXmaI\n\n\n\n\nAd particle (viral particle [VP]) concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the optical density at 260 nm (OD260). Infectious titers (IU/ml) of progeny viruses were determined by limiting dilution assay on 293 cells. Briefly, tenfold serially diluted virus was used to infect exponentially growing 293 cells in 96-well plates. At 48 hours postinfection, GFP-positive cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope. The infectious titer was calculated as the average number of GFP-positive cells per well×dilution factor/volume of virus suspension per well. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was calculated from particle titer. The VP/IU ratio was 20∶1 for all virus preparations.\n\nVirus growth curve\n293 or T84 cells seeded in 24-well plates were infected with mu- or wt-Ad3GFP in a volume of 0.5 ml DMEM per well at indicated MOIs. Two hours later, viruses-containing media were removed. The cells were cultivated in 0.75 ml fresh DMEM plus 2% FBS per well. At indicated intervals, cells together with culture media were collected and frozen at −80°C. After all culture plates were collected, the samples were subjected to three cycles of freeze-and-thaw. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12000 g for 2 minutes, and the supernatants were titrated by limiting dilution assay on 293 cells.\n\nAnalysis of PtDd in infected HeLa cells\nHela cells in three 15-cm dishes were infected with virus (wt-Ad3GFP, mu-Ad3GFP, Ad5 or Ad14) in 20 ml medium/dish. 6–12 hours later, virus containing medium was discarded, and 15 ml fresh medium plus 2% FBS was added to each dish. 24–48 hours post infection, culture medium was aspirated to a 50-ml tube. The cells were washed once with 7 ml PBS/dish, scraped down in 4.5 ml PBS (3 dishes), and subjected to 3 rounds of freeze and thaw. Cell debris was removed by spinning at 16 100 g for 4 minutes, and the lysate supernatant was laid on the sucrose gradients. In some indicated cases, the proteins in culture medium were precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to a saturation of 65%, dialyzed against ultracentrifugation buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6), and laid on sucrose gradients. After 4 hours of ultracentrifugation (SW41Ti rotor, 35,000 rpm, 200,000 g), the ultra-clear thin tube was taken out and held vertically on a clamp stand. A syringe needle (size: 18G) was used to penetrate the tube from the side above the 40% sucrose layer. Gradient fractions were collected from the needle and fractioned into tubes. The fractions were mixed with 2×SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, loaded on 4–15% SDS-PAGE at 20 µl/well for cell-associated PtDd or 35 µl/well for released PtDd. Western blots were performed with anti-Ad3 PtDd primary antibody (dilute 1∶2000 for cell-associated PtDd or 1∶1000 for released PtDd) and anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1∶2000).\n\nTransduction studies\nT84 cells were cultured in 0.4 µm transwell insert for 16 days, and then infected with mu-Ad3GFP or wt-Ad3GFP at MOIs of 2, 10 and 50 vp/cell for 2 hours. Supernatants were collected from the inner chambers at days 4, 7, 9 and 10 post infection, and from the outer chambers at days 9 and 10. Progeny virus in the collected culture media was titrated on 293 cells.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy\nCells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 15 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with 1% BSA-PBS plus 0.3% triton X-100, and hybridized with primary antibody and fluorescein labeled secondary antibody. The cellular nuclei were counterstained by mounting samples with vectorshield mounting medium containing DAPI.\nSample slides were observed under a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. Generally, three color signals were collected with multitracking mode, and Z-stacks with a slice thickness of 1 or 2 µm were acquired.\n\nImage morphometry\nImages of E-cadherin staining on T-84 transwell cultures and A549 tumor sections were taken using a Leica DFC300FX digital camera with a Leica DMLB microscope. Ten 20×-magnification pictures per T84 transwell (five sections per well, collected at a distance of 50 µm, 2 infected wells) and fifteen 20×-magnification pictures per A549 tumor (five sections per tumor, collected at a distance of 100 µm, 3 tumors) were analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD) and the E-cadherin-positive area (% E-cadherin area) was calculated based on mm2 E-cadherin per mm2 tumor section. Technical details for morphometry have been described earlier [29].\n\nPermeability assay\nPolarized T84 cells cultured in transwell chambers were exposed to cell lysates or gradient fractions (obtained 24 hours after infection) (20 µg total protein/ml) in adhesion medium (DMEM, 1% FBS, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES) for 15 min at room temperature and TEER was measured and calculated as described elsewhere [18].\n\nAnimal studies\nAll experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines set forth by the University of Washington.

These repair polymerases also confer UVR tolerance, intimately linking mutability and survival in bacteria that colone habitats subject to regular UVR exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we investigate adaptive specificity in experimental lineages of the highly UVR-mutable epiphytic plant pathogen Pseudomonas cichorii 302959. Relative fitness measurements of isolates and population samples from replicate lineages indicated that adaptive improvements emerged early in all lineages of our evolution experiment and specific increases in relative fitness correlated with distinct improvements in doubling and lag times. Adaptive improvements gained under UVR and non-UVR conditions were acquired preferentially, and differentially contributed to relative fitness under varied growth conditions. Conclusions: These results support our earlier observations that MDR activation may contribute to gains in relative fitness without impeding normal patterns of adaptive specificity in P. cichorii 302959. "],"title":"Growth Parameter Components of Adaptive Specificity during Experimental Evolution of the UVR-Inducible Mutator Pseudomonas cichorii 302959","materials_and_methods":["\n        Bacterial strains, growth conditions, and general molecular biology techniques\n        The ancestral ‘round’ strain of P. cichorii 302959 was originally isolated in Japan [13]. In a previous study, sixteen populations of P. cichorii 302959 were derived from a single ancestral colony and propagated by serial transfer for 500 generations in minimal liquid media [12]. Eight UVR lineages (numbered 25–32) received a single, daily dose of UVC (254 nm) radiation to activate mutagenic DNA repair. Cultures were individually mixed 1∶1 with saline (0.85% NaCl) in a glass Petri dish and exposed to ∼40 J m−2 of UVC (254 nm) radiation from an XX-15 UV lamp (UVP Products, San Gabriel, CA) that resulted in ∼10% survival by each lineage population. The energy output of the lamp was monitored with a UV-X radiometer fitted with a UV-25 sensor (UVP Products, San Gabriel, CA) and determined to be 1.5 J m−2 s−1. Following UVR irradiation, cultures were diluted 1∶100 into fresh medium and incubated under dark conditions to minimize photoreactivation. These lineages diversified into a fluctuating coexistence of ‘round’ (R) and ‘fuzzy’ (F) colony morphotypes. Eight non-UVR lineages (numbered 33–40) were diluted daily into fresh medium without MDR activation by UVR exposure and contained only the R morphotype. The culture transfer strategies for both UVR and non-UVR lineages resulted in a 1000-fold daily increase in the growth of each population, representing ∼10 generations of binary fission.\n        Samples from each lineage were periodically preserved in a nonevolving state in 10% glycerol at −80°C. All evolved isolates in this study were derived from the ancestral genotype following either 250 or 500 generations of selection in the lineage experiment (Figure 1). We define “lineage isolates” as single-colony isolates from any of the replicate lineages in this experiment. Evolved isolates are denoted by lineage replicate and morphotype (e.g., 25R refers to an isolate from lineage 25 that exhibits the round colony morphotype). Each lineage contained ∼1010 total P. cichorii 302959 cells at stationary phase, and the relative fitness of these communities has been shown to rely on the ecological interactions of sympatric genotypes [12]. Therefore, lineage communities were also analyzed in this study as population samples; these samples contained ∼108 cells thawed from preserved UVR lineages to maintain the assemblage of diverse genotypes. Isolates and population samples from generation 500 characterized here are identical to those reported previously [12].\n        \n          10.1371/journal.pone.0015975.g001\n          Figure 1\n          \n            Evolutionary history of isolates and population samples derived from experimental lineages of P. cichorii 302959 and characterized in this study.\n            Sixteen parallel lineages of P. cichorii 302959 were derived from a single colony and propagated by serial transfer. Eight UVR lineages received daily UVR exposure and diversified into mixtures of ‘round’ and ‘fuzzy’ colony morphotypes. Eight non-UVR lineages did not receive UVR exposure and contained only the ancestral, ‘round’ colony morphotype. All 16 lineages were propagated for 500 generations and samples from each were periodically preserved. Isolates and population samples in this study were derived from the ancestor following either 250 or 500 generations of selection in the evolution experiment.\n          \n          \n        \n        Strains of P. cichorii were cultured at 28°C in Luria–Burtani (LB) broth (Difco, Detroit, MI), in Davis Minimal broth supplemented with 25 mg l−1 glucose (DM25) (Difco), or on King's medium B (KB) agar [17]. Antibiotics were used where appropriate at the following concentrations: carbenicillin 50 µg ml−1, gentamicin 10 µg ml−1. Competent cell preparation was performed according to Choi et al. [18]. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Miniprep kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Transformation by electroporation, standard agarose gel electrophoresis, and other recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to Sambrook et al. [19].\n      \n        Competition experiments and relative fitness calculations\n        The relative fitness of all isolates and population samples was determined by direct competition with the ancestor under both UVR and non-UVR conditions to identify patterns of specific or general adaptation as described previously [12]. Briefly, competitions were performed under the same UVR and non-UVR conditions as the lineage experiment described above. To ensure that competitors were comparably acclimated to the competition environment, isolates were simultaneously removed from glycerol stocks maintained at −80°C, individually grown in LB broth overnight, and then individually grown for 24 hr in the competition environment. Competitors were mixed at a 1∶1 volumetric ratio, and appropriate dilutions were spread on KB agar in triplicate at 0 and 24 hr to estimate the initial and final density of each. Strain differentiation was accomplished by plasmid-encoded catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE) which causes expressing colonies on agar media to turn yellow when sprayed with 0.1 M catechol. The relative fitness (W) of the two competitors was calculated as the ratio of their realized growth rate as described previously [12]. When the two competitors are equally fit in the competition environment, W = 1.\n        The six replicates of each relative fitness measurement were analyzed by two-tailed, independent t-tests against the hypothesis of mean equal fitness (W = 1). Fitness measurements were compared using two-tailed paired t-tests to determine any significant differences in adaptation between growth intervals (generations 250 vs. 500) or growth environments (UVR vs. non-UVR conditions).\n      \n        Growth curves and calculations\n        Before optical density (OD) measurement, lineage isolates and population samples were grown overnight in LB broth and subcultured into 10 ml DM25 at 28°C for 24 hr acclimation. Cultures were diluted 1000-fold into fresh DM25, and 100 µl samples were removed for OD measurement at 600-nm in 96-well microtiter plates using a Tecan Safire (Tecan US, Inc., Durham, NC). Samples were removed for measurement at 0 hr and at 1 hr intervals from 4 hr to 15 hr. Growth curves for each lineage isolate and population sample were repeated in triplicate under both UVR and non-UVR conditions.\n        OD600 values from growth curves were standardized by dividing by the initial OD600 (0 hr) and then log2 transformed. The transformed values were plotted, and the window of exponential growth was identified by linear regression [20]. Lag time was calculated simply as the x-intercept of the linear equation. Doubling time (g) was determined by the equation:\n        \n        where N1 and N2 are raw, untransformed OD values corresponding to the window of exponential growth observed in the log2 transformation plot and t is the time interval between them [21].\n      \n        UVR tolerance assays\n        Lineage isolates and population samples were grown overnight in LB broth and 2 ml of culture were pelleted, washed with 1 ml saline, resuspended in 1 ml saline, and held on ice. The cell suspensions were mixed with 9 ml saline in a glass petri dish and exposed to a single dose of approximately 140 J m−2 UVC as described above. Cell suspensions were mixed continuously while receiving UVR doses to eliminate survival as a result of shading. Following irradiation, surviving cells were enumerated by dilution plating conducted under dark conditions.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015975/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015975/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0028394","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Mixl1 is a homeodomain transcription factor required for mesoderm and endoderm patterning during mammalian embryogenesis. Despite its crucial function in development, co-factors that modulate the activity of Mixl1 remain poorly defined. Here we report that Mixl1 interacts physically and functionally with the T-box protein Brachyury and related members of the T-box family of transcription factors. Transcriptional and protein analyses demonstrated overlapping expression of Mixl1 and Brachyury during embryonic stem cell differentiation. In vitro protein interaction studies showed that the Mixl1 with Brachyury associated via their DNA-binding domains and gel shift assays revealed that the Brachyury T-box domain bound to Mixl1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter experiments indicated that association of Mixl1 with Brachyury and related T-box factors inhibited the transactivating potential of Mixl1 on the Gsc and Pdgfrα promoters. Our results indicate that the activity of Mixl1 can be modulated by protein-protein interactions and that T-box factors can function as negative regulators of Mixl1 activity.\n      "],"title":"Brachyury and Related Tbx Proteins Interact with the Mixl1 Homeodomain Protein and Negatively Regulate Mixl1 Transcriptional Activity","materials_and_methods":["\n        Plasmids\n        pEF-BOS FLAG Mixl1 was created by cloning a PCR fragment generated from Mixl1 cDNA into the AscI site of pEF-BOS [58]. pMT2-HA Mixl1 and pMT2-HA Goosecoid (Gsc) were created by cloning PCR fragments generated from Mixl1 and Gsc cDNAs into the SalI and EcoRI sites of pMT2-SM HA. pMT2-HA Brachyury (T) was created by cloning a Brachyury cDNA into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pMT2-SM HA. pMT2-HA Tbx6 was created by cloning a Tbx6 cDNA into the NotI and SalI sites of pMT2-SM HA. pMT2-HA Eomoseodermin (Eomes) was created by cloning a Eomes cDNA into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pMT2-SM HA. pMT2-SM HA containing the T-box domain of Brachyury was created by cloning a cDNA encompassing nt 1–687 of Brachyury into the XhoI site of pMT2-SM HA. pMT2-SM HA ΔT-box-Brachyury was created by cloning a cDNA excluding nt 1–687 of mBrachyury into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pMT2-SM HA. To ensure nuclear localization of the Brachyury T-box and ΔT-box-Brachyury proteins an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (PKKKRKV) [59] was cloned between the NotI/SalI sites and NotI/XhoI sites upstream of the cDNAs for pMT2-SM HA Brachyury T-box and pMT2-SM HA ΔT-box-Brachyury, respectively. pMT2-HA Oct4 and Oct6 were created by cloning cDNAs spanning the coding regions of each gene into the XhoI and EcoRI sites (for Oct4) and the SalI and EcoRI sites (for Oct6) of pMT2-SM HA. To obtain N-terminally fused GST-tagged proteins, Mixl1, Brachyury, Tbx3, Tbx6, Tbx20 and Eomes cDNA sequences were generated by PCR from a day 4 differentiated Mixl1GFP/w ESC [13] cDNA library, and cloned into the pDONR221 entry vector via the BP reaction (Gateway Technology, Invitrogen). pENTRY clones were subsequently used in LR reactions (Invitrogen) with the expression vector pDEST27 (GST).

The cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in mice treated with Ad-si-IL-17 was significantly higher than in control mice; however, CD8+ T cells from splenocytes had similar activity levels. Suppression of IL-17A at tumor sites led to a Th1-dominant environment, and moreover, eliminated myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells at tumor sites but not in splenocytes. In conclusion, blockade of IL-17A at tumor sites helped suppress tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation at tumor sites.\n      "],"title":"Inhibition of IL-17A in Tumor Microenvironment Augments Cytotoxicity of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Tumor-Bearing Mice","materials_and_methods":["\n        Ethics Statement\n        This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the School of Medicine, Wakayama Medical University (Permit Number: 440). Murine melanoma cell line B16 and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 were purchased from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresourses (JCRB, Osaka, Japan), and murine chemically induced colon carcinoma cell line MC38 was obtained from Dr. F. James Primus [22].\n      \n        Mice and cell lines\n        Female 6- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were used for the experiment. The murine chemically induced colon carcinoma cell line MC38 and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 were maintained in DMEM (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Murine melanoma cell line B16 was grown in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.\n      \n        Construction of the recombinant adenovirus vector\n        The murine IL-17A expression vector, cloned into pBApo-CMV-Neo vector (Takara, Otsu, Japan), was constructed and two murine IL-17A siRNA expression vectors, cloned into pcPURmU6i vector, were constructed. IL-17A and IL-17A siRNA plasmids cotransfected 293 cells, and we selected the IL-17A siRNA plasmid that could force lower IL-17A expression (data not shown), the sequences was as follows: 5′-GTTTAGGTTAACTTCAAGGTCTTACGTGTGCTGTCCGTAAGACTTTGAGGTTGAGGTTGACCTTTTT-3′. The IL-17A siRNA fragment was excised and ligated into cosmid vector pAxcwit2 (Takara) to yield Ad-si-IL-17. The recombinant Ad-si-IL-17 was generated by the COS-TPC method as previously described [22] and was used in vivo after purification with Vivapure AdenoPACK (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany).\n      \n        Design of in vivo experiments\n        C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×105 MC38 cells (n = 7/group), and at 5, 8, and 11 d, PBS, Ad-SNC, or Ad-si-IL-17 with 1×109 PFU was injected intratumorally. In the same way B16 tumor models were inoculated with 1×106 cells and adenovirus vectors were injected on days 7, 10, and 13. All mice were killed when the long diameter of the tumor reached 2 cm. Tumor size was estimated using the following formula: (short diameter)2 × long diameter ×0.52.\n      \n        Measurement of cytokine and chemokine content in tumor tissues and in vitro\n        We prepared tumor homogenates as described previously [23], [24], [25]. In brief, tumor tissues were homogenized in cold PBS, and then sonicated for 10 min. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the total protein concentrations in supernatants were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The IL-17A, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CCL2 content in supernatants were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). For IL-6 assay, content in supernatants was measured using cytometric bead array system (CBA) (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer's manual. For the VEGF and IL-17A levels produced by MC38 and B16 in vitro, 2×105 cells were cultured for 48 h in 6-well plate and the supernatants were measured using ELISA kit.\n      \n        Preparation of splenocytes and TILs\n        Spleens were filtered through a 70-µm nylon mesh, and live splenocytes were collected by 100% Ficoll-PREMIUM (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) gradient centrifugation. Tumor tissues were dissected and digested in complete RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 µM 2-ME (Wako), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mg/ml collagenase, and 0.2 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min; 0.5 mg/ml DNaseI (Sigma) was then added and the suspension was left at 37°C for another 15 min. The tumor suspension was next filtered through a 70-µm nylon mesh and live lymphocytes were collected by 80%/100% Ficoll gradient centrifugation. For T-cell sorting, CD5+ cells were isolated from the splenocytes or TILs using autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).\n      \n        Cytotoxicity assay\n        Spleens and tumor tissues were removed at 14 d after MC38 cell inoculation, and then in vivo primed splenocytes or TILs were cocultured (4×106/ml) with irradiated (7,500 rad) MC38 cells (4×104/ml) in complete RPMI1640 medium containing recombinant IL-2 at 50 IU/ml. TILs were pooled from four to five mice. After 72 h of coculture, CD8+ T cells were isolated from in vitro restimulated splenocytes or TILs using autoMACS. Cytotoxicity was tested using a 4 h 51Cr-release assay, as described previously [22].\n      \n        Flow cytometric analysis\n        For analysis of MDSCs, splenocytes or TILs were stained with PerCP -Cy5.5–conjugated anti-CD45, FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b, and PE-conjugated anti-Gr-1 mAb (BD) for 30 min on ice. For analysis of Treg cells, splenocytes or TILs stained with PerCP -Cy5.5–conjugated anti-CD3, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (BD) for 30 min on ice. For intracellular staining, after fixation and permeabilization using Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience), the cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-FOXP3 mAb (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4°C. For analysis of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells, splenocytes or TILs were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) (Sigma) for 5 h in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD). Then, the cells were harvested and stained with PerCP -Cy5.5–conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (BD) for 30 min on ice. For intracellular staining, after fixation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD), the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-IFN-γ, PE-conjugated anti-IL-4 mAb, PE-conjugated anti-IL-17 mAb (BD) for 30 min on 4°C. After washing, the cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur, using CELLQuest (BD Biosciences).\n      \n        Immunohistochemistry and quantitative microscopy\n        For immunohistochemical staining of CD31 specific for endothelial tissue, 10-µm sections were prepared from frozen tumor tissues. For immunohistochemical staining of MMP9, 4-µm sections were prepared from paraffin-embedded blocks derived from tumor tissues. The primary antibodies, rat anti-CD31 mAb (1∶100, BD) and rabbit anti-MMP9 Ab (1∶100, R&D), were incubated overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplex was visualized by a polymer envision method, histofine simple stain (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). Vessel counts were assessed according to the criteria of Weidner et al [26]. Vessels in five high-power fields (×200 magnification) were counted. Positive cells were quantified by an image-processing application (Win ROOF, version 5.5; Mitani).\n      \n        Statistical analysis\n        The following statistical analyses were used. For data in Figures 1(A), we used the one-way ANOVA. A Student's t test or a Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between experimental and control groups.

Methods: We analyzed four classes of lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL2, HDL3) from both male (n = 8, 69±4 year-old) and female (n = 25, 53±7 year-old) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as well as controls with similar age (n = 13). Results: Although RA group showed normal levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and glucose, however, the RA group showed significantly reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C level and ratio of HDL-C/TC. The RA group showed significantly elevated levels of blood triglyceride (TG), uric acid, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. The RA group also showed elevated levels of advanced glycated end (AGE) products in all lipoproteins and severe aggregation of apoA-I in HDL. As CETP activity and TG contents were 2-fold increased in HDL from RA group, paraoxonase activity was reduced upto 20%. Electron microscopy revealed that RA group showed much less HDL2 particle number than control. LDL from the RA group was severely oxidized and glycated with greater fragmentation of apo-B, especially in female group, it was more atherogenic via phagocytosis. Conclusion: Lipoproteins from the RA patients showed severely altered structure with impaired functionality, which is very similar to that observed in coronary heart patients. These dysfunctional properties in lipoproteins from the RA patients might be associated with high incidence of cardiovascular events in RA patients.

Patients, who were diagnosed with RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [14] were enrolled in this study. Average duration of RA was 10±2 and 15±4 years for male and female patients respectively. Around 50% of patients were taken corticosteroid with 5.0±3.1 and 2.2±2.7 mg/day for male (n = 4 in 8) and female (n = 13 in 25) patients, respectively. Heavy alcohol consumers (>30 g EtOH/day) and those who had consumed any prescribed drugs to treat hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension were excluded. All subjects had unremarkable medical records without illicit drug use or past histories of systemic diseases. All patients were informed about the study and signed the informed consent prior to enrollment in the study, and the Institutional Review Board at the Medical Center of Seoul National University (Seoul, South Korea) approved the protocol. The recruitment study period was from January 2013 to November 2015.\nRA patients were classified according to their disease activity scores using a 28 joint count (DAS-28) [15]. Moderate-high disease activity was defined as a DAS-28 score >3.2 (Active RA, n = 13), while low disease activity was defined as a DAS-28 score <3.2 (Inactive RA, n = 20). Beside corticosteroids, major medications for RA patients were Methotrexate (MTX, n = 28) and NSAIDs (n = 25). Minor medications were sulfasalazine (n = 8), hydroxychloroquine (n = 9), and leflonomide (n = 5). Only two patients took a statin while one patient took an ACE inhibitor. Control subjects were voluntarily recruited from those who attended the Health Promotion Program of Seoul National University Hospital for regular health examinations. All were interviewed, and absence of clinical evidence of RA was confirmed by thorough examination of medical history and physical examination\n\nBlood analysis\nBlood was obtained from both RA patients and control after overnight fasting state immediately before the procedure. Blood was collected using a vacutainer (BD sciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) containing EDTA (final 1 mM). Plasma was isolated by low speed centrifugation and stored at -80°C until analysis. Blood parameters such as lipids and glucose concentrations were determined using an automatic blood analyzer (Chemistry analyzer AU4500 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and by manual determination using a commercially available assay kit. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, triglycerides (TG), and glucose levels were determined using commercial assay kits (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using Friedewald formula, LDL-C = TC-(HDL-C +(TG/5)). Blood uric acid level was analyzed according to the previous method by Caraway [16].\n\nIsolation of lipoproteins\nVery low-density lipoproteins (VLDL, d<1.019 g/mL), LDL (1.019<d<1.063), HDL2 (1.063<d<1.125), and HDL3 (1.125<d<1.225) were isolated from individual patients and control plasma via sequential ultracentrifugation [17], with density adjusted by addition of NaCl and NaBr in accordance with standard protocols. Samples were centrifuged for 24 hours at 10°C at 100,000g using a Himac CP-90α (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at the Instrumental Analysis Center of Yeungnam University.\nTo analyze individual lipoproteins, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured using commercially available kits (cholesterol, T-CHO and TG, Cleantech TS-S; Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Protein concentrations in lipoproteins were determined via Lowry protein assay, as modified by Markwell et al [18]. To assess the degree of oxidation of individual LDL, concentration of oxidized species in LDL was determined by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method using malondialdehyde as a standard [19].\nTo compare the extent of glycation between groups, content of AGEs in individual lipoproteins was determined from fluorescence measurements at 370 nm (excitation) and 440 nm (emission), as described previously [20].\n\nCopper-mediated LDL-oxidation\nTo assess copper-mediated LDL oxidation, 300 μg of LDL was incubated with 5 μM CuSO4 for up to 3 hours. During incubation, the quantity of formed conjugated dienes was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 234 nm (Abs234) and 37°C [21] using a Beckman DU 800 spectrophotometer equipped with a MultiTemp III thermocirculator.\nTo verify spectroscopic data, oxLDL samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.5% agarose gel to compare relative electromobilities [22]. The post-oxidative electrophoretic mobility of LDL was compared via electrophoresis on a 0.5% agarose gel due to modification of amino acids in apo-B and phospholipids by oxidation.\n\nFerric reducing ability of plasma assay\nThe ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) was determined using the method described by Benzie and Strain [23] with a slight modification, as described recently by our research group [24]. The antioxidant activities of individual HDL fractions (20 μg each in PBS) were then estimated by measuring the increase in absorbance induced by generated ferrous ions.\n\nCholesteryl ester transfer assay\nA rHDL-containing apoA-I and cholesteryl oleate was synthesized in accordance with the method described by Matz and Jonas [25], modified by Cho [26] using trace amounts of [3H]-cholesteryl oleate (TRK886, 3.5 μCi/mg of apoA-I; GE Healthcare). The rHDL was immobilized using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) for easy separation of rHDL after the reaction, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. CE transfer reaction was performed in 300-μL reaction mixtures containing human plasma (20 μL) or HDL3 (20 μL, 2 mg/mL) as a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), [3H]-rHDL-agarose (20 μL, 0.25 mg/mL) as a CE-donor, and human LDL (20 μL, 0.25 mg/mL) as a CE-acceptor source, as described previously [27]. After incubation at 37°C with shaking around 200 rpm, the reaction was halted via brief centrifugation (10,000g) for 3 min at 4°C to sediment [3H]-rHDL-agarose. Supernatants containing CE-acceptor (150 μL) and the agarose pellet (50 μL) were then separately subjected to scintillation counting, and percentage transfer of [3H]-CE from [3H]-rHDL to LDL was calculated. For non-specific reactions, a parallel experiment was simultaneously carried out in the control tube, which includes all constituents except the CETP source.\n\nParaoxonase assay\nParaoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity was determined by measuring the initial velocity of p-nitrophenol production at 37°C, as determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (microplate reader, Bio-Rad model 680; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), as described previously [28] with slight modification [29]. Prior to the measurement, HDL was extensively dialyzed against PBS to remove EDTA.\n\nELISA and Western blot\nIn order to quantify plasma CETP, each wells of a polystyrene microplate (#3590; Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with the anti-human CETP rabbit antibody (ab19012; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a concentration of 0.25 μg/mL and incubated overnight at 4°C. Equally diluted each plasma sample was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, anti-human CETP mouse antibody (ab2726; abcam, 1 μg/mL) was treated and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. To develop color reaction, anti-mouse IgG antibody (ab6728; abcam, 0.5 μg/mL conjugated with Horse Radish Peroxidase, was treated. For color development, 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (Cat. No. 555214; BD Biosciences, Flanklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was treated and quantified by Victor X4 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).\nApolipoprotein/lipoprotein compositions were compared via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with identical protein loading quantities (3 μg of total protein per lane) from individual HDL3, and expression levels of apolipoprotein were analyzed via immunodetection. Anti-human apoA-I antibody (ab7613), anti-paraoxonase antibody (ab24261), anti-IL-6 antibody (ab6672) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Phosphorylated IkB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) and beta-actin antibody (Bethyl lab A300-491A; Montgomery, TX). Relative band intensity (BI) was compared via band scanning with Chemi-Doc® XRS+ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using Image Lab software (Version 5.2). Relative band intensity (BI) was compared via band scanning with Gel Doc® XR (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software (version 4.5.2).\n\nElectron microscopy\nTransmitted electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a Hitachi electron microscope (model H-7600; Ibaraki, Japan) operated at 80 kV, as in our previous report [30]. HDL2 was negatively stained with 1% sodium phosphotungastate (pH 7.4) with a final apolipoprotein concentration of 0.3 mg/mL in TBS.\n\nPhagocytosis of LDL into macrophages\nTHP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, were maintained and differentiated into macrophages as described previously [31]. The differentiated and adherent macrophages were then rinsed with warm PBS and incubated with 400 μL of fresh RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% FBS and 50 μL each of LDL (1 mg of protein/mL in PBS) from each group for 48 hours at 37°C in a humidified incubator. After incubation, cells were fixed and stained with oil-red O (0.67%) to visualize LDL. Cell lysate was collected and immunodetected with phospho-IκB antibody and beta-actin antibody.\n\nData analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean±SD from at least three independent experiments with duplicate samples. Data comparisons were assessed by Student’s t-test between the groups, χ2 test for categorical variables, and non-parametric test for comparison of means using the SPSS program (version 14.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/introduction","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164564/supporting_information","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053130","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction is a diagnostic criterion of Type 2 diabetes and includes defects in glucose transport and insulin secretion. In healthy individuals, β-cells maintain plasma glucose concentrations within a narrow range in concert with insulin action among multiple tissues. Postprandial elevations in blood glucose facilitate glucose uptake into β-cells by diffusion through glucose transporters residing at the plasma membrane. Glucose transport is essential for glycolysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In human Type 2 diabetes and in the mouse model of obesity-associated diabetes, a marked deficiency of β-cell glucose transporters and glucose uptake occurs with the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Recent studies have shown that the preservation of glucose transport in β-cells maintains normal insulin secretion and blocks the development of obesity-associated diabetes. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we have constructed a computational model of human β-cell glucose transport in health and in Type 2 diabetes, and present a systems analysis based on experimental results from human and animal studies. Our findings identify a metabolic threshold or “tipping point” whereby diminished glucose transport across the plasma membrane of β-cells limits intracellular glucose-6-phosphate production by glucokinase. This metabolic threshold is crossed in Type 2 diabetes and results in β-cell dysfunction including the loss of glucose stimulated insulin secretion.

Methods: Patients (treatment-naïve or relapsers on prior Alfa/RBV treatment) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Lambda/RBV/TVR or Alfa/RBV/TVR. Total duration of treatment was either 24 or 48 weeks (response-guided treatment), with TVR administered for the first 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a sustained virologic response at post treatment week 12 (SVR12), which was tested for noninferiority of Lambda/RBV/TVR. Results: A total of 838 patients were enrolled, and 617 were treated; 411 and 206 patients received Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR, respectively. The majority of patients were treatment-naïve, with HCV GT-1b and a high baseline viral load (≥800,000 IU/mL). Less than 10% of patients had cirrhosis (Lambda, 7.5%; Alfa, 6.8%). Lambda/RBV/TVR did not meet the criterion for noninferiority (lower bound of the treatment difference interval was -12.3%); the SVR12 in all patients (modified intent-to-treat) was 76.2% in the Lambda arm and 82.0% in the Alfa arm. Overall, the frequency of adverse events in each arm was comparable (Lambda, 91.7%; Alfa, 97.1%). As expected based on the safety profile of the 2 interferons, there were more hepatobiliary events observed in the Lambda arm and more hematologic events in the Alfa arm. Conclusions: In this comparison of Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR in patients who were treatment-naïve or had relapsed on prior Alfa/RBV treatment, Lambda failed to demonstrate noninferiority based on SVR12 results. Treatment with Lambda/RBV/TVR was associated with a higher incidence of relapse. More patients discontinued Lambda/RBV/TVR treatment during the first 4 weeks of study treatment, mainly due to hepatobiliary-related events, and more Lambda patients were lost to follow-up. "],"title":"A Randomized Study of Peginterferon Lambda-1a Compared to Peginterferon Alfa-2a in Combination with Ribavirin and Telaprevir in Patients with Genotype-1 Chronic Hepatitis C","materials_and_methods":["\nTrial design\nThis was a randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 study in patients with GT-1 chronic HCV infection (treatment-naïve or relapsed following prior Alfa/RBV treatment) (supporting CONSORT checklist is available as supporting information; see S1 Checklist). Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive Lambda (180 μg by subcutaneous [SC] injection once weekly) or Alfa (180 μg by SC injection once weekly), each administered in combination with RBV (1000 mg per day orally for patients weighing <75 kg and 1200 mg per day orally for patients weighing ≥75 kg) plus TVR (750 mg orally 3 times daily) during the first 12 weeks, followed by either Lambda/RBV or Alfa/RBV for a total treatment duration of 24 or 48 weeks depending on the achievement or not, respectively, of an extended rapid virologic response (eRVR; defined as undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12 of treatment). Patients with cirrhosis completed a total of 48 weeks of treatment, regardless of their eRVR status. At the completion of treatment, all patients were to receive off-treatment follow-up for 48 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to interleukin-28B (IL28B) host GT (CC vs. non-CC), treatment-naïve versus prior relapse status, and HCV GT (1a vs. 1b), and was performed by a sponsor-designated center via an Interactive Voice Response System using a block size of 6. Both site and subjects were blinded to treatment for the entire study. A designated member of the study staff at each investigative site was unblinded and responsible for dispensing study medication.\n\nPatients\nThe study population was comprised of adults (aged ≥18) who were naïve to prior anti-HCV therapy (including IFN and DAA), or prior relapsers to Alfa/RBV, with GT-1a or -1b chronic HCV infection and HCV RNA ≥100,000 IU/mL. Patients with cirrhosis as determined by either liver biopsy indicating METAVIR score F4 or equivalent, or by FibroScan® score ≥14.6 kPa were eligible to participate. After the trial started, the protocol was amended to exclude patients with significant portal hypertension (eg, hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] ≥10 mmHg, splenomegaly ≥12 cm (diameter), and a Fibroscan score >21 kPa) who could be at an increased risk of developing hepatic decompensation during treatment. Patients who were co-infected with hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), had other medical conditions contributing to chronic liver disease, had current or prior evidence of portal hypertension, or had previous exposure to a DAA were excluded from participating.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying the European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). The study protocol and any amendments were approved by the institutional review board/independent ethics committee at each site (Protocol and IRBs available as supporting information; see S1 Protocol and S1 IRBs), and all patients provided written informed consent. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01598090 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01598090?term=nct01598090&rank=1)\n\nEndpoints and assessments\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved SVR at post treatment week 12 (SVR12). Secondary efficacy endpoints included: the proportion of patients who achieved rapid virologic response (RVR; defined as undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment); eRVR; end of treatment response (EOTR); and the proportion of treatment-naïve patients who achieved SVR12.\nSecondary safety endpoints included the proportion of patients with: rash-related dermatologic events reported during the first 12 weeks of treatment; treatment-emergent cytopenic abnormalities defined as hemoglobin <10 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count <750 x 106/L, and platelet count <50000 x 106/L; on-treatment flu-like symptoms; on-treatment musculoskeletal symptoms; serious adverse events (SAEs); discontinuation due to AEs; dose reductions throughout the study; and laboratory abnormalities. Laboratory abnormalities were measured and graded using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (grade 1–2, mild to moderate; grade 3–4, severe to potentially life-threatening).\nPlasma HCV RNA was assessed using the COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test v2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, California, USA) with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. HCV RNA was assessed at baseline, week 2, every 2 weeks through week 12, then at weeks 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48, and at post-treatment follow-up weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48.\nTreatment was discontinued if any of the following futility criteria were met: (1) HCV RNA >1000 IU/mL at week 4 or 12; (2) confirmed HCV RNA detected at week 24; or (3) a virologic breakthrough, defined as a confirmed increase in HCV RNA >1 × log10 above nadir or HCV RNA ≥LLOQ after previously having HCV RNA <LLOQ while on treatment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary endpoint, SVR12, was tested for noninferiority between Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR treatment arms. Power calculations to determine appropriate sample sizes assumed a 79% response rate for both Lambda/RBV/TVR and Alfa/RBV/TVR and a −12% boundary for comparison with the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference (Lambda/RBV/TVR—Alfa/RBV/TVR). Sample sizes of 406 patients treated with Lambda/RBV/TVR and 203 patients treated with Alfa/RBV/TVR, resulted in a 95% power to demonstrate noninferiority of Lambda/RBV/TVR to Alfa/RBV/TVR for the proportion of patients with SVR12.\nAnalyses were performed using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which includes all randomized patients who received at least one treatment dose. Patients with missing data for an endpoint were treated as nonresponders. Treatment differences in SVR12 rate and 95% CI were estimated using the stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel approach. All testing was performed at a significance level of 0.05.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/title","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/abstract","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/references","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/body","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1003719/abstract","journal":"PLoS Pathogens"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164563/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLOS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129","journal":"PLoS ONE","abstract":["\n        Protein phosphorylation is a complex regulatory event that is involved in the signaling networks that affect virtually every cellular process. The protein phosphorylation may be a novel source for discovering biomarkers and drug targets. However, a systematic analysis of the phosphoproteome in patients with SLE has not been performed. To clarify the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we compared phosphoprotein expression in PBMCs from SLE patients and normal subjects using proteomics analyses. Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 from PBMCs isolated from 15 SLE patients and 15 healthy subjects and then analyzed by automated LC-MS/MS analysis. Phosphorylation sites were identified and quantitated by MASCOT and MaxQuant. A total of 1035 phosphorylation sites corresponding to 618 NCBI-annotated genes were identified in SLE patients compared with normal subjects. Differentially expressed proteins, peptides and phosphorylation sites were then subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Gene ontology(GO) and pathway analyses showed that nucleic acid metabolism, cellular component organization, transport and multicellular organismal development pathways made up the largest proportions of the differentially expressed genes. Pathway analyses showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton regulators made up the largest proportions of the metabolic pathways. Network analysis showed that rous sarcoma oncogene (SRC), v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), histone deacetylase (HDA1C) and protein kinase C, delta (PRKCD) play important roles in the stability of the network.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A group of 15 SLE patients who had never been treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or other immunosuppressive drugs was recruited for this study. Patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other symptomatic treatments were excluded. All patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. In addition, we choose 15 healthy subjects as controls.\n      \n        PBMCs Isolation and Protein Extraction\n        Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by a Ficoll-Paque (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) density gradient centrifugation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 2 ml blood (with EDTA as an anticoagulant) was layered on 3 ml Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) and centrifuged for 25 min at 1300 rpm at room temperature. Mononuclear cells at the interface were aspirated with a Pasteur pipette, washed twice in PBS with centrifugation for 10 min at 900 rpm at room temperature and resuspended in 500 µl SDT lysate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The samples were then stored at −80°C until further use.\n      \n        Phosphopeptide Enrichment\n        Phosphopeptides from digested peptides were enriched using the Phosphopeptide Enrichment TiO2 kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the tryptic digest was dried, dissolved in 200 µL TiO2 Phosphobind buffer containing 50 g/L 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and then mixed with 50 µL TiO2 Phosphobind Resin. After a 40 minute incubation, the supernatant was discarded, and the TiO2 resin was washed twice with the washing buffer. Then, elution buffer was added to elute the phosphopeptides in two batches. The eluted supernatant was pooled and dried by evaporation for LC-MS/MS analysis.\n      \n        LC-MS/MS Analysis\n        The dried phosphopeptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis with a Finnigan Surveyor High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC) system coupled with a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). Briefly, the peptide mixtures were loaded onto a C18 column (100 µm i.d., 10 cm long, 5 µm, resin from Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) using an autosampler. Peptides were eluted in a 5–35% gradient of buffer solution over 180 min and then detected in the LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer as described previously [9], [10].\n      \n        Raw MS Data Analysis\n        Raw Orbitrap full-scan MS and ion trap MSA spectra were processed using the MaxQuant algorithms [11], [12]. Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot through automated database matching of all tandem mass spectra against an in-house curated concatenated target database. Scoring was performed in MaxQuant as described previously. We required strict trypsin enzyme specificity and allowed up to two missed cleavage sites. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (Cys, +57.021464 Da) was searched as a fixed modification, whereas N-acetylation of proteins (N-terminal, +42.010565 Da), oxidized methionine (Met,+15.994915 Da), and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylations (Ser/Thr/Tyr, +79.966331 Da) were searched as variable modifications.\n      \n        Peptide filtering and Phosphorylation Site Identification\n        The Mascot result files were imported into the MaxQuant software suite for further processing. In MaxQuant, we defined the estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of all peptide and protein identifications at 1% by automatically filtering based on peptide length, mass error precision estimates, and the Mascot scores of all forward and reversed peptide identifications. The final estimate of true phosphorylated amino acids remaining within all identified phosphopeptide sequences was calculated in MaxQuant based on the localization probabilities of all assumed threonine, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites using the PTM score algorithm, as described previously [13].For protein identification, we used IPI database. A protein group was removed if all identified peptides assigned to this protein group were also assigned to another protein group. Tosort out a single protein member from a protein group, we chose the protein from the Swiss-Prot database and with the highest sequence coverage. When using label-free approach to identify differently expressed protein and calculating the coefficient of variance, the number of spectra of each protein was logarithmtransformed.\n      \n        Different Gene Screening and Statistical Analyses\n        For screening of phosphorylation sites between the two groups, we used the following method. 1, caculate the fold change between the two groups. 2. set threshold value is 1, that is the average fold change between SLE patients group and healthy controls group was more than or equal to 2 folds; and the p value of single sample t-test was less than or equal to 0.05. T-test was conducted using MATLAB 7.5. 3. labeling the gene name corresponding protein according to the NCBI annotation information.\n      \n        Bioinformatics Analysis\n        The expression values calculated for the differential proteins and peptides were used for distance and average to determine linkage for gene ontology (GO) analysis. In pathway analysis, interactions between genes in the range of genomes were analyzed by downloading the pathway data in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG). Finally, the results of the above data were merged into a comprehensive gene inter-relationship network. The established gene network was able to directly reflect the inter-relationships between genes at a whole-cell level, as well as the stability of the gene regulatory network.\n      "]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/references","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/body","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/introduction","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/results_and_discussion","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/materials_and_methods","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0053129/supporting_information","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164562","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":["\nHeterochronic development has been proposed to have played an important role in the evolution of echinoderms.

Historical errors, confusing juvenile stages with paedomorphic species, show the difficulties in correctly identifying the effects of heterochrony on development and evolution. This study presents a detailed analysis of 40 species with morphologies showing various degrees of juvenile appearance in late ontogeny. They are compared to a range of early ontogenetic stages from paedomorphic and non-paedomorphic species. Both quantitative and qualitative measurements are taken and analysed. The results suggest that strongly paedomorphic species are usually larger than other species at comparable developmental stage. The findings support recent notions of polyphyletic origin of the families Ophiuridae and Ophiolepididae.

Here we present preclinical evidence that the sorbitol derivative meglumine (N-methyl-D-glucamine) can safely protect against several features of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, as well as elicit enhancement in muscle stamina. Meglumine is a compound routinely used as an approved excipient to improve drug absorption that has not been ascribed any direct biological effects in vivo. Normal mice (SV129) administered 18 mM meglumine orally for six weeks did not display any gastrointestinal or other observable adverse effects, but had a marked effect on enhancing muscle stamina and at longer times in limiting weight gain. In the established KK.Cg-Ay/J model of non-insulin dependent diabetes, oral administration of meglumine significantly improved glycemic control and significantly lowered levels of plasma and liver triglycerides. Compared to untreated control animals, meglumine reduced apparent diabetic nephropathy. Sorbitol can improve blood glucose uptake by liver and muscle in a manner associated with upregulation of the AMPK-related enzyme SNARK, but with undesirable gastrointestinal side effects not seen with meglumine. In murine myoblasts, we found that meglumine increased steady-state SNARK levels in a dose-dependent manner more potently than sorbitol. Taken together, these findings provide support for the clinical evaluation of meglumine as a low-cost, safe supplement offering the potential to improve muscle function, limit metabolic syndrome and reduce diabetic complications.\n"],"title":"Meglumine Exerts Protective Effects against Features of Metabolic Syndrome and Type II Diabetes","materials_and_methods":["\nEthics Statement\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by The Lankenau Institute for Medical Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved (Permit Number: A11-2997).\n\nAnimals\nKK.Cg-Ay/J mice develop type 2 diabetes by 8 wk of age as characterized by onset of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and obesity [16]. 4–6 week old KK.Cg-Ay/J mice (n = 20 per group) were given water ad libitum with or without 18 mM meglumine hydrochloride (salt prepared from commercial meglumine obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO), kept in 12 hr night/day light cycles and fed ad libitum. Equal numbers of female and male animals were used.\n\nGlucose Measurement\nDiabetes was confirmed in KK.Cg-Ay/J mice by blood glucose measurement using a “One Touch” blood glucose monitoring system (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Animals were considered hyperglycemic when, after a 4 hr fast, their blood glucose levels were above 250 mg/dl.\n\nMesh Grip Test\nMice (SV129) (n = 15 per group) were treated with or without meglumine (18 mM in drinking water), for at least 30 days were placed on a mesh wire cage 50 cm above a cage filled with soft bedding. After adjustment to this new environment for 3–5 seconds, the cage was slowly inverted. Before the cage was inverted, the investigator visually confirmed that the animal was gripping the wire mesh on the cage with all limbs. After cage inversion, the grip time on the mesh wire cage before falling was recorded. This test was repeated 3 times for all mice with a 24 hr resting period between tests. The mean time mice held their grip on the mesh cage, while inverted, was employed as simple indicator of muscle strength [17].\n\nNephropathy Analysis\nKidneys were examined from KK.Cg-Ay/J animals that had been hyperglycemic for 7 months. Renal slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and deparaffinized in xylene before preparation of 4 µm sections and staining with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson trichrome. The pathologist who scored the extent of renal injury was blind to the treatment groups. The score was based on morphometric analysis of the glomerular disease and interstitial fibrosis. A rating scale from 0 to 4 was used with 0 meaning normal appearance and 4 meaning very severe lesions.\n\nGlucose Challenge\nAfter animals had fasted for 4 hrs, their basal glucose level was measured using a “One Touch” blood glucose monitoring system (Lifescan). They were then injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 1 g/Kg body weight of 10 mg/ml D-glucose in PBS. Blood glucose levels were measured at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes following injection.\n\nLipid Analysis\nTriglyceride levels were measured in mice using colorimetric assays. For this, lipids were extracted, from serum and liver, as described by Naik et al [18]. Briefly, after extraction and evaporation, the lipid layer was resuspended in 0.25 ml 1% Triton X-100. Triglyceride concentrations were then determined using the L-Type Triglyceride M enzymatic based assay kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond VA). Results for liver tissue were expressed as microgram triglycerides per mg tissue.\n\nWestern Analysis\nC2C12 mouse myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Manassas VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells treated with or without meglumine at the concentrations and for the times indicated were harvested by scraping, washing twice in PBS and lysing in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal protein for each sample (typically 50 µg/lane) was separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica MA).

D. setosum-a (AY012747 and AY012746), D. setosum-b (AY012732 and AY012733), D. savignyi (AY012742 and AY012743), and Diadema-sp (AY012744 and AY012745) sequences previously reported [3] were incorporated into the phylogenetic tree construction. Neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods were applied to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using MEGA v6 [5], in which the gamma-corrected Kimura's two parameter (K2P) distance was selected as the best-fit model for nucleotide substitution.\n\nMorphological analyses\nUnderwater photographic images of live individuals were compared. Diameter and height of naked tests were measured, and primary tubercle arrangements on the interambulacral coronal plates were recorded.\n"]},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102376/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102376/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003563/title","journal":"PLoS ONE"},{"id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003563/abstract","journal":"PLoS ONE"}]}}
